Venlafaxine (VEN) was the sixth most-prescribed antidepressant in the USA in 2017. Therefore, we reviewed studies which focused on the pharmacogenetics of VEN and found that there is a lack of guidelines for pharmacogenetic testing for VEN. Within investigated genetic polymorphisms, few of them can be indicated as potential predictors of VEN efficacy and tolerance. However, additional pharmacogenetic studies of VEN should be performed to reproduce already obtained results or explain contradictory ones. The individualization of pharmacotherapy is a key issue in providing patients with the highest possible quality of treatment, therefore pharmacogenetic studies should be one of the components of therapy optimization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2217/pgs-2019-0031,"Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Genotype;Humans;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Venlafaxine Hydrochloride/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",31368838,

Recognizing the current lack of consensus within the field, the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics assembled a group of experts to conduct a narrative synthesis of the PGx literature, prescribing guidelines, and product labels related to psychotropic medications as well as the key considerations and limitations related to the use of PGx testing in psychiatry. The group concluded that to inform medication selection and dosing of several commonly-used antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, current published evidence, prescribing guidelines, and product labels support the use of PGx testing for 2 cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19). In addition, the evidence supports testing for human leukocyte antigen genes when using the mood stabilizers carbamazepine (HLA-A and HLA-B), oxcarbazepine (HLA-B), and phenytoin (CYP2C9, HLA-B). For valproate, screening for variants in certain genes (POLG, OTC, CSP1) is recommended when a mitochondrial disorder or a urea cycle disorder is suspected. Although barriers to implementing PGx testing remain to be fully resolved, the current trajectory of discovery and innovation in the field suggests these barriers will be overcome and testing will become an important tool in psychiatry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1055/a-1288-1061,"Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;HLA Antigens/genetics;Humans;Pharmacogenomic Testing/*methods/standards;Practice Guidelines as Topic;Psychiatry/*methods/standards;Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn/drug therapy/genetics;Pharmacogenetics",33147643,
Does Pharmacogenomic Testing Improve Clinical Outcomes for Major Depressive Disorder? A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials and Cost-Effectiveness Studies.,2017,6,,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,1555-2101 (Electronic),78,6,720-729,Rosenblat JD and Lee Y and McIntyre RS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28068459/,eng,,United States,"OBJECTIVE: Pharmacogenomic testing has become scalable and available to the general public. Pharmacogenomics has shown promise for predicting antidepressant response and tolerability in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). In theory, pharmacogenomics can improve clinical outcomes by guiding antidepressant selection and dosing. The current systematic review examines the extant literature to determine the impact of pharmacogenomic testing on clinical outcomes in MDD and assesses its cost-effectiveness. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published prior to October 2015. Search terms included various combinations of the following: major depressive disorder (MDD), depression, mental illness, mood disorder, antidepressant, response, remission, outcome, pharmacogenetic, pharmacogenomics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic, genetic testing, genome wide association study (GWAS), CYP450, personalized medicine, cost-effectiveness, and pharmacoeconomics. STUDY SELECTION: Of the 66 records identified from the initial search, relevant clinical studies, written in English, assessing the cost-effectiveness and/or efficacy of pharmacogenomic testing for MDD were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Each publication was critically examined for relevant data. RESULTS: Two nonrandomized, open-label, 8-week, prospective studies reported overall greater improvement in depressive symptom severity in the group of MDD subjects receiving psychiatric care guided by results of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing (GeneSight) when compared to the unguided group. One industry-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, 10-week prospective study reported a trend for improved outcomes for the GeneSight-guided group; however, the trend did not reach statistical significance. Another industry-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, 12-week prospective study reported a 2.5-fold increase in remission rates in the CNSDose-guided group (P < .0001). One naturalistic, unblinded, industry-sponsored study showed clinical improvement when pharmacogenomics testing guided prescribing; however, this study lacked a control group. A single cost-effectiveness study concluded that single gene testing was not cost-effective. Conversely, a separate study reported that combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing is cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of studies have shown promise for the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic testing; however, cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics, as well as demonstration of improved health outcomes, is not yet supported with replicated evidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.4088/JCP.15r10583,"*Clinical Trials as Topic;*Cost-Benefit Analysis;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Humans;*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care;*Pharmacogenomic Testing/economics/methods/statistics & numerical data;Depressive Disorder;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Depressive Disorder, Major;Pharmacogenetics",28068459,

There are a number of studies that have found promising associations between a variety of biomarkers and clinical response to psychopharmacological treatment in various psychiatric disorders. These biomarkers include neuroimaging, electrophysiology, peripheral serum, and plasma biomarkers, and variations in genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Ultimately, the best model for precision medicine in complex, multifactorial diseases such as psychiatric illnesses will likely involve integrated methodology that combines information from multiple sources including biologic, clinical, and environmental data.

Patients often have to undergo multiple medication trials for weeks to months before finding an effective treatment. Clinical factors such as severity of baseline symptoms and the presence of specific individual (anhedonia or insomnia) or cluster (atypical, melancholic, or anxious) of symptoms are commonly used without any evidence of their utility in selecting among currently available antidepressants. Genomic and proteomic biomarker have gained recent attention for their potential in informing antidepressant medication selection. In this report, we have reviewed some of the major pharmacogenomics studies along with individual genetic and proteomic biomarker of antidepressant response. Additionally, we have reviewed the blood-based protein biomarkers that can inform selection of one antidepressant over another. Among all currently available biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) appears to be the most promising and pragmatic choice. Low CRP (<1 mg/L) in patients with MDD predicts better response to escitalopram while higher levels are associated with better response to noradrenergic/dopaminergic antidepressants. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the superiority of a CRP-based treatment assignment over high-quality measurement-based care in real-world clinical practices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: book chapter",10.1007/164_2018_171,"Biomarkers/*chemistry;*Depression/drug therapy/psychology;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/psychology;Humans;Pharmacogenetics;Proteomics;Biological Markers",30341727,

RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, various polymorphisms associated with differential antidepressant efficacy, tolerability, and safety have emerged in association studies, but mixed findings, limited effect sizes, and poor control of confounders have prevented findings translating to practice. Although promising steps have been made, empirically robust clinically translatable pharmacogenetic tests are not yet established. The complex neurobiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) together with the evolving understanding of genetic processes present research challenges for clinical translation. SUMMARY: Early reports of clinical utility are published. The current evidence base for antidepressant pharmacogenetics is, however, not yet empirically robust enough to inform routine prescribing guidelines. Over the coming years, genetically guided versus unguided trials will help determine if antidepressant pharmacogenetics merits more widespread application.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1097/YCO.0000000000000023,"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Clinical Trials as Topic;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Meta-Analysis as Topic;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents",24270480,

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pharmacogenomic testing affects antidepressant medication selection and whether such testing leads to better clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A pragmatic, randomized clinical trial that compared treatment guided by pharmacogenomic testing vs usual care. Participants included 676 clinicians and 1944 patients. Participants were enrolled from 22 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers from July 2017 through February 2021, with follow-up ending November 2021. Eligible patients were those with MDD who were initiating or switching treatment with a single antidepressant. Exclusion criteria included an active substance use disorder, mania, psychosis, or concurrent treatment with a specified list of medications. INTERVENTIONS: Results from a commercial pharmacogenomic test were given to clinicians in the pharmacogenomic-guided group (n = 966). The comparison group received usual care and access to pharmacogenomic results after 24 weeks (n = 978). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The co-primary outcomes were the proportion of prescriptions with a predicted drug-gene interaction written in the 30 days after randomization and remission of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (remission was defined as PHQ-9 ≤ 5). Remission was analyzed as a repeated measure across 24 weeks by blinded raters. RESULTS: Among 1944 patients who were randomized (mean age, 48 years; 491 women [25%]), 1541 (79%) completed the 24-week assessment. The estimated risks for receiving an antidepressant with none, moderate, and substantial drug-gene interactions for the pharmacogenomic-guided group were 59.3%, 30.0%, and 10.7% compared with 25.7%, 54.6%, and 19.7% in the usual care group. The pharmacogenomic-guided group was more likely to receive a medication with a lower potential drug-gene interaction for no drug-gene vs moderate/substantial interaction (odds ratio [OR], 4.32 [95% CI, 3.47 to 5.39]; P < .001) and no/moderate vs substantial interaction (OR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.52 to 2.84]; P = .005) (P < .001 for overall comparison). Remission rates over 24 weeks were higher among patients whose care was guided by pharmacogenomic testing than those in usual care (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.57]; P = .02; risk difference, 2.8% [95% CI, 0.6% to 5.1%]) but were not significantly higher at week 24 when 130 patients in the pharmacogenomic-guided group and 126 patients in the usual care group were in remission (estimated risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -2.4% to 5.3%]; P = .45). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with MDD, provision of pharmacogenomic testing for drug-gene interactions reduced prescription of medications with predicted drug-gene interactions compared with usual care. Provision of test results had small nonpersistent effects on symptom remission.

Little is known about the genetic factors associated with treatment response. We did a genome-wide association study of antipsychotic treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: The discovery cohort comprised patients with schizophrenia from 32 psychiatric hospitals in China that are part of the Chinese Antipsychotics Pharmacogenomics Consortium. Patients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to six groups (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and haloperidol or perphenazine; those assigned to haloperidol or perphenazine were subsequently assigned [1:1] to one or the other) for 6 weeks. Antipsychotic response was quantified with percentage change on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for their association with treatment response. Linkage-disequilibrium-independent SNPs that exhibited potential associations (ie, p<1 × 10(-5)) were tested in a validation cohort comprising patients from the Chinese Antipsychotics Pharmacogenetics Consortium from five collaborative hospitals, who were treated with olanzapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole for 8 weeks. FINDINGS: The discovery cohort contained 2413 patients and the validation cohort 1379 patients. In the discovery cohort, we identified three novel SNPs (rs72790443 in MEGF10 [p=1·37 × 10(-8)], rs1471786 in SLC1A1 [p=1·77 × 10(-8)], and rs9291547 in PCDH7 [p=4·48 × 10(-8)]) that were associated with antipsychotic treatment response at a genome-wide significance level. These associations were confirmed in the validation cohort (p<0·05). In the combined sample of the discovery and validation cohorts, we identified five novel loci showing genome-wide significant associations with general antipsychotic treatment response (rs72790443 in MEGF10 [p=1·40 × 10(-9)], rs1471786 in SLC1A1 [p=2·33 × 10(-9)], rs9291547 in PCDH7 [p=3·24 × 10(-9)], rs12711680 in CNTNAP5 [p=2·12 × 10(-8)], and rs6444970 in TNIK [p=4·85 × 10(-8)]). In antipsychotic-specific groups, after the combination of results from both samples, the rs2239063 SNP in CACNA1C was associated with treatment response to olanzapine (p=1·10 × 10(-8)), rs16921385 in SLC1A1 was associated with treatment response to risperidone (p=4·40 × 10(-8)), and rs17022006 in CNTN4 was associated with treatment response to aripiprazole (p=2·58 × 10(-8)). INTERPRETATION: We have identified genes related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter receptors, and schizophrenia risk that are associated with response to antipsychotics. These findings improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying treatment responses, and the identified biomarkers could eventually guide choice of antipsychotic in patients with schizophrenia.

Predictors of antidepressant response and adverse effects to ketamine remain poorly understood due to contradictory results. The objective of the systematic review herein is to identify and evaluate the extant literature assessing pharmacogenomic predictors of ketamine clinical benefits and adverse effects. Electronic databases were searched from inception to July 2021 to identify relevant articles. Twelve articles involving 1,219 participants with TRD, 75 who underwent elective surgeries and received ketamine as an anesthetic, 49 with pain, and 68 healthy participants met the inclusion criteria and enrolled to this review. While identified articles reported mixed results, three predictors emerged: 1) Val66Met (rs6265) brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Met allele) was associated with reduced antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects, 2) CYP2B6*6 (e.g., CYB2B6 metabolizer) was associated with more severe dissociative effects and 3) NET allelic (rs28386840) variant were associated with greater cardiovascular complications (e.g., moderate to severe treatment emergent hypertension). Several important limitations were identified, most notably the small sample sizes and heterogeneity of study design and results. Taken together, preliminary evidence suggests the potential for pharmacogenomic testing to inform clinical practices; however, further research is needed to better determine genetic variants of greatest importance and the clinical validity of pharmacogenomics to help guide ketamine treatment planning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.11.036,Ketamine;Pharmacogenetics,34844049,

Several neurobiological hypotheses have been postulated as responsible for SCZ pathogenesis: polygenic/multifactorial genomic defects, intrauterine and perinatal environment-genome interactions, neurodevelopmental defects, dopaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABAergic), neuropeptidergic and glutamatergic/N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) dysfunctions, seasonal infection, neuroimmune dysfunction, and epigenetic dysregulation. SCZ has a heritability estimated at 60-90%. Genetic studies in SCZ have revealed the presence of chromosome anomalies, copy number variants, multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms of susceptibility distributed across the human genome, aberrant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA genes, mitochondrial DNA mutations, and epigenetic phenomena. Pharmacogenetic studies of psychotropic drug response have focused on determining the relationship between variation in specific candidate genes and the positive and adverse effects of drug treatment. Approximately, 18% of neuroleptics are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 40% of CYP2D6, and 23% of CYP3A4; 24% of antidepressants are major substrates of CYP1A2 enzymes, 5% of CYP2B6, 38% of CYP2C19, 85% of CYP2D6, and 38% of CYP3A4; 7% of benzodiazepines are major substrates of CYP2C19 enzymes, 20% of CYP2D6, and 95% of CYP3A4. About 10-20% of Western populations are defective in genes of the CYP superfamily. Only 26% of Southern Europeans are pure extensive metabolizers for the trigenic cluster integrated by the CYP2D6+CYP2C19+CYP2C9 genes. The pharmacogenomic response of SCZ patients to conventional psychotropic drugs also depends on genetic variants associated with SCZ-related genes. Consequently, the incorporation of pharmacogenomic procedures both to drugs in development and drugs on the market would help to optimize therapeutics in SCZ and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1111/j.1755-5949.2010.00187.x,"Animals;Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19;Genomics/*methods/trends;Humans;Pharmacogenetics/*methods/trends;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Schizophrenia/*diagnosis/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Genome;Pharmacogenetics;Genomics",20718829,PMC6493868

Our understanding of the genetic etiology of BD has greatly increased in recent years with advances in technology and methodology as well as the adoption of international consortiums and large population-based biobanks. It is clear that BD is also highly heterogeneous and polygenic and shows substantial genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies of BD suggest that the number of associated loci is expected to substantially increase in larger future studies and with it, improved genetic prediction of the disorder. Still, a number of challenges remain to fully characterize the genetic architecture of BD. First among these is the need to incorporate ancestrally-diverse samples to move research away from a Eurocentric bias that has the potential to exacerbate health disparities already seen in BD. Furthermore, incorporation of population biobanks, registry data, and electronic health records will be required to increase the sample size necessary for continued genetic discovery, while increased deep phenotyping is necessary to elucidate subtypes within BD. Lastly, the role of rare variation in BD remains to be determined.

Although lithium is considered the first-line treatment, a large percentage of patients do not respond sufficiently. Moreover, lithium can induce severe side effects and has poor tolerance and a narrow therapeutic index. The genetics of lithium response has been largely investigated, but findings have so far failed to identify reliable biomarkers to predict clinical response. This has been largely determined by the highly complex phenotipic and genetic architecture of lithium response. To this regard, collaborative initiatives hold the promise to provide robust and standardized methods to disantenagle this complexity, as well as the capacity to collect large samples of patietnts, a crucial requirement to study the genetics of complex phenotypes. The International Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen) has recently published the largest study so far on lithium response reporting significant associations for two long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). This result provides relevant insights into the pharmacogenetics of lithium supporting the involvement of the noncoding portion of the genome in modulating clinical response. Although a vast body of research is engaged in dissecting the genetic bases of response to lithium, the several drawbacks of lithium therapy have also stimulated multiple efforts to identify new safer treatments. A drug repurposing approach identified ebselen as a potential lithium mimetic, as it shares with lithium the ability to inhibit inositol monophosphatase. Ebselen, an antioxidant glutathione peroxidase mimetic, represents a valid and promising example of new potential therapeutic interventions for BD, but the paucity of data warrant further investigation to elucidate its potential efficacy and safety in the management of BPD. Nevertheless, findings provided by the growing field of pharmacogenomic research will ultimately lead to the identification of new molecular targets and safer treatments for BPD.

The ultimate promise of personalized medicine would be fulfilled with the identification of disease biomarkers that would be widely available for use in diagnosis and treatment. Progress, however, has been slow in providing disease biomarkers or approved diagnostic tests. This is true for major depressive disorder (MDD), despite its prevalence in the general population and the widespread acceptance of its biological basis. Studies using strategies like genome-wide association and candidate gene analyses have identified a number of possible biomarkers of MDD, including serum levels of neurotrophic factors, inflammatory cytokines and HPA axis hormones, but none have proven sufficiently powerful for clinical use. The lack of biologically based tests available for use in identifying patients with MDD is a significant impediment to personalized and more effective treatment, because it means diagnosis continues to be driven by subjective symptoms. While genetic studies of MDD have not yet led to diagnostic and treatment biomarkers, progress in determining the role of the genome in drug metabolism heralds the first effort in personalized prescribing for the antidepressants. The FDA suggested and approved genotyping tests for common variants of drug metabolism genes, such as the cytochrome p450s. By using these tests a physician can select an appropriate antidepressant for a given patient, as differences in clearance, half-life, and peak blood concentrations are controlled by genetic variability in drug metabolism. Personalization in drug choice can be achieved because these tests: (1) identify responders and non-responders; (2) provide alerts to possible adverse drug events; and (3) help optimize dose. Improved ways of diagnosing and prescribing effective treatments for MDD are needed, as the available methods are inadequate and symptom based. In the foreseeable future, further interrogation of the genome may serve as the basis for development of new personalized medicine strategies for diagnosis and treatment of MDD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.metabol.2012.08.021,"*Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use;Biomarkers/blood;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics;Cytokines/blood;Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics;*Genetic Markers;Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism;*Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods/standards/trends;Nerve Growth Factors/blood;Neurotransmitter Agents/blood;Pharmacogenetics;*Precision Medicine/methods/trends;Primary Health Care/standards/trends;Surveys and Questionnaires;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major",23021040,PMC4672728

Many studies have so far tried to identify molecular and genetic markers that could help us to predict response to mood stabilizers or the risk for adverse drug reactions.

Pharmacogenetics is the field of research that attempts to unravel the relationship between genetic variation affecting drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic level) or drug targets (pharmacodynamic level) and interindividual differences in pharmacoresponse. In schizophrenia, pharmacokinetic studies have shown the role of genetic variants of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 in the metabolism of neuroleptic drugs. At the level of the drug target, variants of the dopamine D3 and D4, and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors have been examined. A general problem of pharmacogenetic studies in schizophrenia is the high number of controversial findings which may be related to the lack of standardized phenotype definition. Recently, guidelines for an exact and comparable phenotype characterization have been proposed and will aid in designing and evaluating pharmacogenetic studies in the future. The final goal of pharmacogenetic studies-making a prediction of drug response at the level of the individual patient-will require a simultaneous look at a large number of response-determining genetic variants by applying the tools of pharmacogenomics, e.g. large-scale Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection and genotyping.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1002/(sici)1096-8628(200021)97:1<98::aid-ajmg12>3.0.co;2-w,"Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics;Forecasting;Humans;Phenotype;Psychotropic Drugs/metabolism/*pharmacology;Receptors, Neurotransmitter/metabolism;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics",10813809,

Seventy-six patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and an index major depressive episode were included in an observational retrospective study.

Multiple linear regression was used to identify pharmacogenetic and clinical predictors of efficacy and tolerability of medications. The pharmacogenetic variables response to serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (ABCB1) and reduced metabolism of quetiapine (CYP3A4) predicted patient response to these medications, respectively. ABCB1 was also linked to the tolerability of SNRIs. An mTOR-related multigenic predictor was also associated with a lower number of adverse effects when including switch and autolytical ideation.

The most significant results are the association between drug metabolic polymorphisms, mainly in cytochrome P450 genes, with variations in drug metabolic rates and side effects. Patients with genetically determined CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (PMs) status may require lower doses of antipsychotic. Alternatively, CYP2D6 ultrarapid matabolizers (UMs) will need increased drug dosage to obtain therapeutic response. Additionally, polymorphisms in dopamine and serotonin receptor genes are repeatedly found associated with response phenotypes, probably reflecting the strong affinities that most antipsychotics display for these receptors. In particular, there is important evidence suggesting association between dopamine 2 receptor (D2) polymorphisms (Taq I and -141-C Ins/Del) and a dopamine 3 receptor (D3) polymorphism (Ser9Gly) with antipsychotic response and drug-induced tardive dyskinesia. Additionally, there is accumulating evidence indicating the influence of a 5-HT2C polymorphism (-759-T/C) in antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Application of this knowledge to clinical practice is slowly gathering pace, with pretreatment determination of individual's drug metabolic rates, via CYP genotyping, leading the field. Genetic determination of patients' metabolic status is expected to bring clinical benefits by helping to adjust therapeutic doses and reduce adverse reactions. Genetic tests for the pretreatment prediction of antipsychotic response, although still in its infancy, have obvious implications for the selection and improvement of antipsychotic treatment. These developments can be considered as successes, but the objectives of bringing pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic research in psychiatric clinical practice are far from being realized. Further development of genetic tests is required before the concept of tailored treatment can be applied to psychopharmatherapy. This review aims to summarize the key findings from the last decade of research in the field.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) provided many top markers, even if none of them reached genome-wide significance. CONCLUSIONS: AD pharmacogenetics have not produced any knowledge applicable to routine clinical practice yet, as results were mainly inconsistent across studies.

Response to antipsychotic therapy is highly variable, and it is not currently possible to predict those patients who will or will not respond to antipsychotic medication. Furthermore, a high percentage of patients, approximately 30%, are classified as treatment-resistant (treatment-resistant schizophrenia; TRS). TRS is defined as a non-response to at least two trials of antipsychotic medication of adequate dose and duration. These patients are usually treated with clozapine, the only evidence-based pharmacotherapy for TRS. However, clozapine is associated with severe adverse events. For these reasons, there is an increasing interest to identify better targets for drug development of new compounds and to establish better biomarkers for existing medications. The ability of antipsychotics to improve psychotic symptoms is dependent on their antagonist and reverse agonist activities at different neuroreceptors, and some genetic association studies of TRS have focused on different pharmacodynamic factors. Some genetic studies have shown an association between antipsychotic response or TRS and neurodevelopment candidate genes, antipsychotic mechanisms of action (such as dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic) or pharmacokinetic factors (i.e., differences in the cytochrome families). Moreover, there is a growing body of literature on the structural and functional neuroimaging research into TRS. Neuroimaging studies can help to uncover the underlying neurobiological reasons for such resistance and identify resistant patients earlier. Studies examining the neuropharmacological mechanisms of antipsychotics, including clozapine, can help to improve our knowledge of their action on the central nervous system, with further implications for the discovery of biomarkers and the development of new treatments. The identification of the underlying mechanisms of TRS is a major challenge for developing personalized medicine in the psychiatric field for schizophrenia treatment. The main goal of precision medicine is to use genetic and brain-imaging information to improve the safety, effectiveness, and health outcomes of patients via more efficiently targeted risk stratification, prevention, and tailored medication and treatment management approaches.

Despite evidence implicating a strong genetic basis for the pathophysiology of MDD, there are no adequately validated biomarkers of treatment response routinely used in clinical practice. Pharmacoepigenetics is an emerging field that has the potential to combine both genetic and environmental information into treatment selection and further the goal of precision psychiatry. However, this field is in its infancy compared to the more established pharmacogenetics approaches. METHODS: We prepared a narrative review using literature searches of studies in English pertaining to pharmacoepigenetics and treatment of depressive disorders conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, and Ovid Medicine from inception through January 2019. We reviewed studies of DNA methylation and histone modifications in both humans and animal models of depression. RESULTS: Emerging evidence from human and animal work suggests a key role for epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, in the prediction of antidepressant response. The challenges of heterogeneity of patient characteristics and loci studied as well as lack of replication that have impacted the field of pharmacogenetics also pose challenges to the development of pharmacoepigenetic tools. Additionally, given the tissue specific nature of epigenetic marks as well as their susceptibility to change in response to environmental factors and aging, pharmacoepigenetic tools face additional challenges to their development. LIMITATIONS: This is a narrative and not systematic review of the literature on the pharmacoepigenetics of antidepressant response. We highlight key studies pertaining to pharmacoepigenetics and treatment of depressive disorders in humans and depressive-like behaviors in animal models, regardless of sample size or methodology. While we discuss DNA methylation and histone modifications, we do not cover microRNAs, which have been reviewed elsewhere recently.

They are also highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders. Currently there are no objective measures, such as blood tests, used in clinical practice, and available treatments do not work in everybody. The development of blood tests, as well as matching of patients with existing and new treatments, in a precise, personalized and preventive fashion, would make a significant difference at an individual and societal level. Early pilot studies by us to discover blood biomarkers for mood state were promising [1], and validated by others [2]. Recent work by us has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track suicidality, a tragic behavioral outcome of mood disorders, using powerful longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) [3-6]. These studies showed good reproducibility with subsequent independent genetic studies [7]. More recently, we have conducted such studies also for pain [8], for stress disorders [9], and for memory/Alzheimer's Disease [10]. We endeavored to use a similar comprehensive approach to identify more definitive biomarkers for mood disorders, that are transdiagnostic, by studying mood in psychiatric disorders patients. First, we used a longitudinal within-subject design and whole-genome gene expression approach to discover biomarkers which track mood state in subjects who had diametric changes in mood state from low to high, from visit to visit, as measured by a simple visual analog scale that we had previously developed (SMS-7). Second, we prioritized these biomarkers using a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach encompassing in a comprehensive fashion prior published evidence in the field. Third, we validated the biomarkers in an independent cohort of subjects with clinically severe depression (as measured by Hamilton Depression Scale, (HAMD)) and with clinically severe mania (as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)). Adding the scores from the first three steps into an overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) score, we ended up with 26 top candidate blood gene expression biomarkers that had a CFE score as good as or better than SLC6A4, an empirical finding which we used as a de facto positive control and cutoff. Notably, there was among them an enrichment in genes involved in circadian mechanisms. We further analyzed the biological pathways and networks for the top candidate biomarkers, showing that circadian, neurotrophic, and cell differentiation functions are involved, along with serotonergic and glutamatergic signaling, supporting a view of mood as reflecting energy, activity and growth. Fourth, we tested in independent cohorts of psychiatric patients the ability of each of these 26 top candidate biomarkers to assess state (mood (SMS-7), depression (HAMD), mania (YMRS)), and to predict clinical course (future hospitalizations for depression, future hospitalizations for mania). We conducted our analyses across all patients, as well as personalized by gender and diagnosis, showing increased accuracy with the personalized approach, particularly in women. Again, using SLC6A4 as the cutoff, twelve top biomarkers had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting depression after all four steps: NRG1, DOCK10, GLS, PRPS1, TMEM161B, GLO1, FANCF, HNRNPDL, CD47, OLFM1, SMAD7, and SLC6A4. Of them, six had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting both depression and mania, hence bipolar mood disorders. There were also two biomarkers (RLP3 and SLC6A4) with the strongest overall evidence for mania. These panels of biomarkers have practical implications for distinguishing between depression and bipolar disorder. Next, we evaluated the evidence for our top biomarkers being targets of existing psychiatric drugs, which permits matching patients to medications in a targeted fashion, and the measuring of response to treatment. We also used the biomarker signatures to bioinformatically identify new/repurposed candidate drugs. Top drugs of interest as potential new antidepressants were pindolol, ciprofibrate, pioglitazone and adiphenine, as well as the natural compounds asiaticoside and chlorogenic acid. The last 3 had also been identified by our previous suicidality studies. Finally, we provide an example of how a report to doctors would look for a patient with depression, based on the panel of top biomarkers (12 for depression and bipolar, one for mania), with an objective depression score, risk for future depression, and risk for bipolar switching, as well as personalized lists of targeted prioritized existing psychiatric medications and new potential medications. Overall, our studies provide objective assessments, targeted therapeutics, and monitoring of response to treatment, that enable precision medicine for mood disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41380-021-01061-w,Drug Repositioning;Humans;*Mood Disorders/drug therapy/genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;*Precision Medicine;Reproducibility of Results;Risk Assessment;Mood Disorders;Pharmacogenetics,33828235,PMC8505261
TSPAN5 influences serotonin and kynurenine: pharmacogenomic mechanisms related to alcohol use disorder and acamprosate treatment response.,2021,7,,Molecular psychiatry,1476-5578 (Electronic),26,7,3122-3133,Ho MF and Zhang C and Zhang L and Wei L and Zhou Y and Moon I and Geske JR and Choi DS and Biernacka J and Frye M and Wen Z and Karpyak VM and Li H and Weinshilboum R,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32753686/,eng,,,"We previously reported that SNPs near TSPAN5 were associated with plasma serotonin (5-HT) concentrations which were themselves associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). TSPAN5 SNPs were also associated with alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk. The present study was designed to explore the biological function of TSPAN5 with a focus on 5-HT and kynurenine concentrations in the tryptophan pathway. Ethanol treatment resulted in decreased 5-HT concentrations in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuron culture media, and the downregulation of gene expression of TSPAN5, DDC, MAOA, MAOB, TPH1, and TPH2 in those cells. Strikingly, similar observations were made when the cells were treated with acamprosate-an FDA approved drug for AUD therapy. These results were replicated in iPSC-derived astrocytes. Furthermore, TSPAN5 interacted physically with proteins related to clathrin and other vesicle-related proteins, raising the possibility that TSPAN5 might play a role in vesicular function in addition to regulating expression of genes associated with 5-HT biosynthesis and metabolism. Downregulation of TSPAN5 expression by ethanol or acamprosate treatment was also associated with decreased concentrations of kynurenine, a major metabolite of tryptophan that plays a role in neuroinflammation. Knockdown of TSPAN5 also influenced the expression of genes associated with interferon signaling pathways. Finally, we determined that TSPAN5 SNPs were associated with acamprosate treatment outcomes in AUD patients. In conclusion, TSPAN5 can modulate the concentrations of 5-HT and kynurenine. Our data also highlight a potentially novel pharmacogenomic mechanism related to response to acamprosate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41380-020-0855-9,"Acamprosate/*pharmacology;Alcohol Drinking;*Alcoholism/drug therapy/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells;*Kynurenine;Neuroinflammatory Diseases;Pharmacogenetics;*Serotonin;*Tetraspanins/genetics;Tryptophan Hydroxylase/genetics;Alcoholics",32753686,PMC7858703

We provide herein a detailed overview of circulating miRNAs and their expression profiles as biomarkers in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and their role in response to specific treatments. Bioinformatics analysis of miR-34a, miR-106, miR-134 and miR-132, which are common among SZ, BD and MDD patients, showed brain enrichment and involvement in the modulation of critical signaling pathways, which are often deregulated in psychiatric disorders.

Moreover, PCEs have been shown to improve cognition in healthy volunteers with no psychiatric disorders.

We also describe evidence that PCEs are being used as cognitive enhancers by healthy people. Crucially, as the lifestyle use of these drugs becomes very popular in the healthy population, a final aim is to present an overview of the current and future neuroethical considerations of enhancing the healthy brain. As information regarding their actual use, benefits and harms in various healthy populations is currently lacking, we propose research that aims to obtain relevant empirical data, monitor the short- and long-term effectiveness and side-effects, and initiate accurate surveys to determine current patterns and quantity of usage of PCE drugs by healthy people.

From a total of 1159 studies initially identified by literature database querying, and after manual assessment and curation of all of them, a mere 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. Of the 18 studies evaluations, 16 studies (88.89%) drew conclusions in favor of PGx testing, of which 9 (50%) genome-guided interventions were cost-effective and 7 (38.9%) were less costly compared to standard treatment based on cost analysis. More precisely, supportive evidence exists for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 drug-gene associations and for combinatorial PGx panels, but evidence is limited for many other drug-gene combinations. Amongst the limitations of the field are the unclear explanation of perspective and cost inputs, as well as the underreporting of study design elements, which can influence though the economic evaluation. Overall, the findings of this article demonstrate that although there is growing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of genome-guided interventions in psychiatric diseases, there is still a need for performing additional research on economic evaluations of PGx implementation with an emphasis on psychiatric disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1038/s41397-021-00249-1,Antipsychotic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use;Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics;Humans;Mental Disorders/drug therapy/*economics/*genetics;Pharmacogenetics/*economics/methods;Pharmacogenetics,34215853,

There exists a need to identify lithium non-responders prior to initiating treatment. The Pharmacogenomics of Bipolar Disorder (PGBD) Study was designed to identify predictors of lithium response. METHODS: The PGBD Study was an eleven site prospective trial of lithium treatment in bipolar I disorder. Subjects were stabilized on lithium monotherapy over 4 months and gradually discontinued from all other psychotropic medications. After ensuring a sustained clinical remission (defined by a score of ≤3 on the CGI for 4 weeks) had been achieved, subjects were followed for up to 2 years to monitor clinical response. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between clinical measures and time until failure to remit or relapse. RESULTS: A total of 345 individuals were enrolled into the study and included in the analysis. Of these, 101 subjects failed to remit or relapsed, 88 achieved remission and continued to study completion, and 156 were terminated from the study for other reasons. Significant clinical predictors of treatment failure (p < 0.05) included baseline anxiety symptoms, functional impairments, negative life events and lifetime clinical features such as a history of migraine, suicidal ideation/attempts, and mixed episodes, as well as a chronic course of illness. CONCLUSIONS: In this PGBD Study of lithium response, several clinical features were found to be associated with failure to respond to lithium.

As lithium is likely to act as a synchronizer and stabilizer of circadian rhythms, we will review pharmacogenetic studies testing circadian gene polymorphisms and prophylactic response to lithium. Interventions such as sleep deprivation, light therapy and psychological therapies may also target sleep and circadian disruptions in BDs efficiently for treatment and prevention of bipolar depression. EXPERT OPINION: We suggest that future research should clarify the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and alterations of the molecular clock in order to identify critical targets within the circadian pathway.

Patients were divided into three CR groups based on years of formal education: no high school completion or equivalent (low-education group [18 patients]), completion of high school or equivalent (moderate-education group [36 patients], or any degree of post-high school education (high-education group [68 patients]). The following pharmacogenomic variants were genotyped for each patient: AGT M268T (rs699), ACE insertion/deletion (or ACE I/D, rs1799752), and APOE ε2, ε3, and ε4 (rs429358 and rs7412). Risk allele carrier status (identified per gene as AGT M268 T carriers, ACE D carriers, and APOE ε4 carriers) was not significantly different among CR groups. The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) scale was used to assess cognitive function. The mean ± SD patient age was 43.9 ± 11.6 years. Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia diagnoses, and use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, did not significantly differ among CR groups. Mixed modeling revealed that risk allele carrier status was significantly associated with lower verbal memory scores for ACE D and APOE ε4 carriers, but AGT T carrier status was significantly associated with higher verbal memory scores (p=0.0188, p=0.0055, and p=0.0058, respectively). These results were only significant in the low-education group. In addition, medication-gene interactions were not significant predictors of BACS scores. ACE D and APOE ε4 carrier status, independent of medication use, was associated with lower verbal memory scores in patients with schizophrenia who had relatively lower CR, as identified by formal education. These results suggest that increasing CR may be protective against cognitive impairment that may be worsened by select cardiovascular risk alleles in patients with schizophrenia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1002/phar.1968,Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects;Apolipoprotein E4/genetics;Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology/*genetics;Cognition/drug effects/*physiology;Cognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics/*methods;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics;Cognition,28605058,PMC5600660
Pharmacogenetic-guided cannabis usage in the community pharmacy: evaluation of a pilot program.,2020,9,1,Journal of cannabis research,2522-5782 (Electronic),2,1,24,Papastergiou J and Li W and Sterling C and van den Bemt B,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33526106/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists possess a skillset suited to provide evidence-based guidance to current and potential users of cannabis. Clinical pharmacogenomics research has made significant progress in defining which genetic variations are important for influencing inter-patient variability in response to cannabis. This study aims to evaluate the practicality and impact of pharmacogenetic testing in the community pharmacy to help guide in the safe use of cannabis. METHODS: The pilot program was designed as open-label, non-randomized, and observational. Two busy, urban community pharmacies, operating under the brand Shoppers Drug Mart, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada offered pharmacogenomic testing to cannabis users as part of their professional services program over a period of 2 months. Eligible patients received buccal swabs using a DNA cheek swab kit. De-identified, barcoded samples were then sent by regular mail to an off-site CLIA-certified laboratory for analysis in Mississauga, Canada. A pharmacogenetic testing platform from Lobo Genetics® was utilized for translation of participants' DNA with respect to CYP2C9, AKT1 and COMT genetic polymorphisms. Following genomic data translation, personalized, evidence-based recommendations were generated. Pharmacists provided a cannabis pharmacogenetic consultation to patients via telephone or in-person. RESULTS: Twenty patients enrolled in the study. Pharmacogenetic screening identified 95% as having the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (suggesting normal THC metabolism); 35 and 25% had AKT1 genotypes suggesting intermediate risk (C/T genotype) or high risk (C/C genotype), respectively, for cannabis-induced psychosis; and 45 and 10% had COMT genotypes suggesting intermediate risk (Val/Met genotype) or high risk (Val/Val genotype), respectively for cannabis-induced neurocognitive impairment. After the pharmacogenetic consultation, 65% of patients reported an increased comfort level in choosing a specific strength/strain of cannabis for use in the future; 75% considered the consultation of high value providing information potentially vital to their health and wellbeing. CONCLUSION: Although the study did not find any CYP2C9 variants associated with highly diminished THC metabolism, most of these patients do carry genetic variants that may potentially predispose them to the development of psychosis and memory impairment. Similar initiatives can potentially improve patient safety and empower individuals to make informed decisions about cannabis use and possible complications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s42238-020-00033-1,Cannabis;Pharmacogenetics,33526106,PMC7819344

It was estimated in 2012 that 11.2% of Canadians experience major depressive disorder (MDD) at least once in their lifetimes and 4.7% of Canadian experience MDD per year. Depression severity is often measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17, also known as HDRS-17). A score of zero to seven indicates no depression; a score of eight to 16 for mild depression; 17 to 23 for moderate depression; and 24 or greater for severe depression. Genetic variants in patients with depression could be the explanation for about 42–50% of individual differences in the antidepressant response rates.(,) With the decreasing cost of genotyping, genetic testing-guided medication therapy has been increasing in popularity around the world. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genes that cause variability in drug response, while pharmacogenomics is broader in context, referring to the collective effect of variability across the genome to modulate drug response. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are often used interchangeably in the published literature. There is a growing number of pharmacogenomics testing-guided decision support tools (DSTs) for patients with depression available worldwide. DSTs work by utilizing algorithms to combine results of genetic variants into a report to guide healthcare practitioners in prescribing of antidepressants and choosing the dosing regimen based on whether the patient is a poor, normal, extensive or ultra-metabolizer.(,) The more recently developed second-generation tools differ from the first-generation tools in their ability to simultaneously assess and interpret multiple genetic markers. Given that most psychiatric medications are processed by and interact with multiple biological pathways, the multiple genetic marker approach is suggested to be important in evaluating pharmacotherapy and drug response. However, the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of these pharmacogenomics testing tools remain uncertain and has been the topic of much debate. The purpose of this report is to examine the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomic testing versus treatment as usual for treating all severities of diagnosed depression. Additionally, evidence-based guidelines regarding the pharmacogenomic testing in patients with all severities of diagnosed depression will be reviewed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: book chapter",,,33074624,

Out of the 17 genes we reviewed, 8 genes were entered into the meta-analysis (SLC6A4, HTR1A, HTR2A, TPH1, gene encoding the beta-3 subunit, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), HTR3A and HTR3B). TPH1 218C/C genotype (7 studies, 754 subjects) was significantly associated with a better response (odds ratio, OR=1.62; P=0.005) with no heterogeneity between ethnicities. A better response was also observed in subjects with the Met variant within the BDNF 66Val/Met polymorphism (4 studies, 490 subjects; OR=1.63, P=0.02). Variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism within intron 2 (STin2) 12/12 genotype showed a trend toward a better response in Asians (STin2: 5 studies, 686 subjects; OR=3.89, P=0.03). As for side effects, pooled ORs of serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) l (9 studies, 2642 subjects) and HTR2A -1438G/G (7 studies, 801 subjects) were associated with a significant risk modulation (OR=0.64, P=0.0005) and (OR=1.91, P=0.0006), respectively. Interestingly, this significance became more robust when analyzed with side effect induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors only (5-HTTLPR: P=0.0001, HTR2A: P<0.0001). No significant result could be observed for the other variants. These results were not corrected for multiple testing in each variant, phenotype and subcategory. This would have required a Bonferroni significance level of P<0.0023.

The ability to rapidly identify optimal treatment, thereby shortening the time to symptomatic remission, could reduce these risks and associated costs. CONTENT: Up to 42% of variance in antidepressant response is associated with common genetic variation, and there are over 10 psychotropic medications for which the US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling reflects a genetic test. Most published studies have examined functional variations in genes of the cytochrome p450 system, relevant to metabolism of many antidepressants. However, there are few data supporting the clinical usefulness of specific pharmacogenetic tests. Randomized trials and cost-effectiveness studies are emerging, but larger-scale studies are needed. Specific challenges in translating genetic association results to clinical practice include need for replication to address risk of type I error, overestimation of effect sizes, absence of data from generalizable cohorts, and absence of comparative data that would suggest one specific intervention over another. Several opportunities to accelerate development and validation of new tools for stratification remain, including integration of these tests with clinical data or other biomarkers and application of electronic health records for test development and investigation. SUMMARY: Although common genetic variation, particularly in genes of the cytochrome p450 system, has been associated with antidepressant response, evidence that this variation may be successfully applied to guide treatment selection is just emerging. Larger-scale studies facilitated by informatics tools will clarify the usefulness of such tests.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1373/clinchem.2013.204446,Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics;Depression/*drug therapy/genetics;Humans;Pharmacogenetics/*trends;*Precision Medicine;Pharmacogenetics;Personality Tests,24281779,

Several candidate genes for schizophrenia may also be associated with bipolar disorder: G72, DISC1, NRG1, RGS4, NCAM1, DAO, GRM3, GRM4, GRIN2B, MLC1, SYNGR1, and SLC12A6. Of these, association with G72 may be most robust. However, G72 haplotypes and polymorphisms associated with bipolar disorder are not consistent with each other. The positional candidate approach showed an association between bipolar disorder and TRPM2 (21q22.3), GPR50 (Xq28), Citron (12q24), CHMP1.5 (18p11.2), GCHI (14q22-24), MLC1 (22q13), GABRA5 (15q11-q13), BCR (22q11), CUX2, FLJ32356 (12q23-q24), and NAPG (18p11). Studies that focused on mood disorder comorbid with somatic symptoms, suggested roles for the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3644 mutation and the POLG mutation. From gene expression analysis, PDLIM5, somatostatin, and the mtDNA 3243 mutation were found to be related to bipolar disorder. Whereas most previous positive findings were not supported by subsequent studies, DRD1 and IMPA2 have been implicated in follow-up studies. Several candidate genes in the circadian rhythm pathway, BmaL1, TIMELESS, and PERIOD3, are reported to be associated with bipolar disorder. Linkage studies show many new linkage loci. In depression, the previously reported positive finding of a gene-environmental interaction between HTTLPR (insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter of a serotonin transporter) and stress was not replicated. Although the role of the TPH2 mutation in depression had drawn attention previously, this has not been replicated either. Pharmacogenetic studies show a relationship between antidepressant response and HTR2A or FKBP5. New technologies for comprehensive genomic analysis have already been applied. HTTLPR and BDNF promoter polymorphisms are now found to be more complex than previously thought, and previous papers on these polymorphisms should be treated with caution.

Since responses to psychopharmacological treatments continue to be sub-optimal, there is a pressing need to identify markers of tolerability and efficacy. Pharmacogenomic studies aim to find such markers within the human genome, and have made some progress in recent years. Progress has been slower in populations with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Here we review 10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that assessed outcomes after antidepressant, antipsychotic, or mood stabilizer treatment. These studies used samples collected by the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), and Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) studies. We highlight findings from African American and European American participants since they are the largest groups studied, but we also address issues related to Asian and Hispanic groups. None of the GWAS we reviewed identified individual genetic markers at genome-wide significance, probably due to limited sample sizes. However, all the studies found poorer outcomes among African American participants. Some of this disparity seems to be explained by psychosocial and economic disadvantages, but at least 2 studies found that widespread genetic differences between participants of European and African ancestry also play an important role. Non-European groups are underrepresented in these studies, but the differences that are evident so far suggest that poorer outcomes among African Americans are not inevitable and may be particularly suited to pharmacogenomic strategies. The vision of more personalized psychopharmacology may critically depend on larger studies in more diverse human populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,not pertinent",,*Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;*Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology;Clinical Trials as Topic;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Pharmacogenetics/*methods/standards/trends;Humanities;Humanism;Antipsychotic Agents;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents,23998447,PMC6011657

Moreover, implementing such testing in routine clinical care is complex, requiring informatics support and a systematic approach to patient and provider education. The PRIME Care program is designed to bridge this gap, applying both clinical trials and implementation science methods to conduct a program of research. It is centered on a large, pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which 2000 Veterans with a major depressive disorder (MDD) and their health care providers are randomized together to receive PGx test results at the beginning of an episode of care or 6 months later. We hypothesize that providers who receive the PGx test results will prescribe an antidepressant guided by the PGx findings and Veterans whose care is guided by PGx testing will experience higher rates of remission from MDD. If the results of the trial replicate those of prior PGx studies, which provided preliminary evidence of the utility of PGx guided prescribing, it would strongly support using a precision medicine approach to treat MDD.

This selective review of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenomic testing (PGT) in BD will focus on candidate genes and genome wide association studies of pharmacokinetic drug metabolism and pharmacodynamic drug response/adverse event, and the potential role of decision support tools that incorporate multiple genotype/phenotype drug recommendations. MAIN BODY: We searched PubMed from January 2013 to May 2019, to identify studies reporting on BD and pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics and PGT. Studies were selected considering their contribution to the field. We summarize our findings in: targeted candidate genes of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways, genome-wide association studies and, PGT platforms, related to BD treatment. This field has grown from studies of metabolizing enzymes (i.e., pharmacokinetics) and drug transporters (i.e., pharmacodynamics), to untargeted investigations across the entire genome with the potential to merge genomic data with additional biological information. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of BD genetics and, the heterogeneity in BD drug-related phenotypes, are important considerations for the design and interpretation of BD PGT. The clinical applicability of PGT in psychiatry is in its infancy and is far from reaching the robust impact it has in other medical disciplines.

Moreover, the time of onset of the clinical improvement is often delayed. Antidepressants as currently available usually enhance serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and may contribute to the inadequate remission rates for major depression. Therefore biomarkers enabling the identification of subgroups of patients and also finding unprecedented targets would provide the basis for personalized medication and thus improve treatment efficacy and reduce side effects. Several pharmacogenetic studies on antidepressant treatment response using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) mapping have been performed but provided only modest findings. Therefore the analysis of gene expression to integrate genomic activity and environmental effects promises a new approach to cope with the complexity of factors influencing antidepressant treatment. Here gene expression studies focusing on candidate genes and genome-wide approaches using RNA derived from peripheral blood cells are reviewed. The most promising findings exist for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, inflammation and neuroplasticity related genes.

They are said to have treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Clozapine is still the only effective treatment for TRS, although it is underused in clinical practice. Initial use is delayed, it can be hard for patients to tolerate, and clinicians can be uncertain as to when to use it. What if, at the start of treatment, we could identify those patients likely to respond to clozapine - and those likely to suffer adverse effects? It is likely that clinicians would feel less inhibited about using it, allowing clozapine to be used earlier and more appropriately. Genetic testing holds out the tantalizing possibility of being able to do just this, and hence the vital importance of pharmacogenomic studies. These can potentially identify genetic markers for both tolerance of and vulnerability to clozapine. We aim to summarize progress so far, possible clinical applications, limitations to the evidence, and problems in applying these findings to the management of TRS. Pharmacogenomic studies of clozapine response and tolerability have produced conflicting results. These are due, at least in part, to significant differences in the patient groups studied. The use of clinical pharmacogenomic testing - to personalize clozapine treatment and identify patients at high risk of treatment failure or of adverse events - has moved closer over the last 20 years. However, to develop such testing that could be used clinically will require larger, multicenter, prospective studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2147/PGPM.S115741,Antipsychotic Agents;Pharmacogenetics;Schizophrenia,27853387,PMC5106233

The authors tried to verify this hypothesis by testing for possible associations between two muscarinic receptor genes (CHRM1 and CHRM2) polymorphisms and TD in patients with schizophrenia.Methods: A total of 472 patients with schizophrenia were recruited. TD was assessed cross-sectionally using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Fourteen allelic variants of CHRM1 and CHRM2 were genotyped using Applied Biosystems amplifiers (USA) and the MassARRAY System by Agena Bioscience.Results: The prevalence of the rs1824024*GG genotype of the CHRM2 gene was lower in TD patients compared to the group without it (χ2 = 6.035, p = 0.049). This suggested that this genotype has a protective effect for the development of TD (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.19-0.88). When age, gender, duration of schizophrenia and dosage of antipsychotic treatment were added as covariates in regression analysis, the results did not reach statistical significance.Conclusions: This study did identify associations between CHRM2 variations and TD; the results of logistic regression analysis with covariates suggest that the association is, however, likely to be secondary to other concomitant factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1080/15622975.2018.1548780,"Adult;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/complications/*genetics;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Hospitals, Psychiatric;Humans;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptor, Muscarinic M1/*genetics;Receptor, Muscarinic M2/*genetics;Schizophrenia/complications/drug therapy/*genetics;Severity of Illness Index;Schizophrenia;Receptors, Muscarinic;Movement Disorders",30623717,

This is particularly relevant in pediatric populations because of concerns about the suicide risk of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), resulting in a black-box warning. However, to date, no specific gene or polymorphism has been consistently implicated as a marker of AD side effect (SE) in the pediatric population. The aim of this study was to examine the association between polymorphisms in genes related to the serotonergic system and citalopram SE's in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD)/dysthymia and/or anxiety disorders. Outpatients (N = 87, 44 % males), aged 7-18 years with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD/dysthymia and/or an anxiety disorder were treated in an 8-week open trial with 20-40 mg/day of citalopram. SE's were rated using a questionnaire devised specifically for this study. Association analysis between known/candidate genetic variants in three genes (5-HTR2A, 5-HTR1Dβ, 5-HTR2C) and SE's was conducted.

The 5-HTR1Dβ CC genotype was associated with more reports of agitation. It has been suggested that agitation may be an intermediate phenotype to suicidal behavior.

The body of evidence that describes the physiology of the placebo effect has been derived from mechanistic studies primarily restricted to the setting of pain. Imaging findings support the role of endogenous opioid and dopaminergic networks in placebo analgesia in both healthy patients as well as patients with painful medical conditions. In patients with psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety disorders or depression, a vast overlap in neurological changes is observed in drug responders and placebo responders supporting the role of serotonergic networks in placebo response.

We used a pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics research strategy to identify genes associated with metabolites that were related to SSRI response. Specifically, 306 MDD patients were treated with citalopram or escitalopram and blood was drawn at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks for blood drug levels, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and metabolomic analyses. SSRI treatment decreased plasma serotonin concentrations (P<0.0001). Baseline and plasma serotonin concentration changes were associated with clinical outcomes (P<0.05). Therefore, baseline and serotonin concentration changes were used as phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS for baseline plasma serotonin concentrations revealed a genome-wide significant (P=7.84E-09) SNP cluster on chromosome four 5' of TSPAN5 and a cluster across ERICH3 on chromosome one (P=9.28E-08) that were also observed during GWAS for change in serotonin at 4 (P=5.6E-08 and P=7.54E-07, respectively) and 8 weeks (P=1.25E-06 and P=3.99E-07, respectively). The SNPs on chromosome four were expression quantitative trait loci for TSPAN5. Knockdown (KD) and overexpression (OE) of TSPAN5 in a neuroblastoma cell line significantly altered the expression of serotonin pathway genes (TPH1, TPH2, DDC and MAOA). Chromosome one SNPs included two ERICH3 nonsynonymous SNPs that resulted in accelerated proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition, ERICH3 and TSPAN5 KD and OE altered media serotonin concentrations. Application of a pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomic research strategy, followed by functional validation, indicated that TSPAN5 and ERICH3 are associated with plasma serotonin concentrations and may have a role in SSRI treatment outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/mp.2016.6,"Adult;Cell Line;Citalopram/therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Genotype;Humans;Male;Metabolomics/*methods;Pharmacogenetics/*methods;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Serotonin/blood;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology;Tetraspanins/genetics/metabolism;Treatment Outcome;Pharmacogenetics;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors",26903268,PMC5003027

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test (IDGx) that has demonstrated effectiveness compared with standard of care (SOC) medication management among patients with varied MDD severity. METHODS: Data from a large prospective, randomized controlled trial of treatment-naive patients or patients with inadequately controlled MDD in general practice and psychiatric treatment settings were used to build a Markov state-transition probability model. Analyses were conducted from the societal perspective. Treatment response rates, mortality rates, direct and indirect medical costs, and utility inputs were derived from the reference study and published scientific literature. The cost of the pharmacogenetic test was $2,000. A 3% discount rate was used to discount costs and effects. Univariate one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of input parameters on net monetary benefit. RESULTS: For moderate to severe MDD, the model estimated a cumulative effect over 3 years of 2.07 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the pharmacogenetic-guided treatment group and 1.97 QALYs for the SOC group, including a lower probability of death from suicide (0.328% and 0.351%, respectively). Total costs over 3 years were $44,697 (IDGx) and $47,295 (SOC). This difference includes a savings of $2,918 in direct medical costs and $1,680 in indirect costs. Results were more pronounced when only severely depressed patients were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetic testing among moderate to severe MDD patients improved QALYs and resulted in cost savings. Sensitivity analyses supported the robust nature of the current findings of the dominant IDGx test to guide treatment.

Therefore, our aim is to investigate the MPH-induced proteomic alterations using an experimental design integrated with a pharmacogenomic analysis in a translational perspective. Proteomic analysis was performed using the cortices of Wistar-Kyoto rats, which were treated by gavage with MPH (2 mg/kg) or saline for two weeks (n = 6/group). After functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in rats, the significant biological pathways were tested for association with MPH response in adults with ADHD (n = 189) using genome-wide data. Following MPH treatment in rats, 98 DEPs were found (P < 0.05 and FC < -1.0 or > 1.0). The functional enrichment analysis of the DEPs revealed 18 significant biological pathways (gene-sets) modulated by MPH, including some with recognized biological plausibility, such as those related to synaptic transmission. The pharmacogenomic analysis in the clinical sample evaluating these pathways revealed nominal associations for gene-sets related to neurotransmitter release and GABA transmission. Our results, which integrate proteomics and pharmacogenomics, revealed putative molecular effects of MPH on several biological processes, including oxidative stress, cellular respiration, and metabolism, and extended the results involving synaptic transmission pathways to a clinical sample.

We have shown in a sample of 401 schizophrenia patients that TCF4 influences verbal memory in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Contrary to expectations, carriers of the schizophrenia-associated allele showed better recognition, thus indicating that while TCF4 influences verbal memory, the TCF4-mediated schizophrenia risk is not determined by the influence of TCF4 on verbal memory. TCF4 does not impact on various other cognitive functions belonging to the domains of attention and executive functions. Moreover, in a pharmacogenetic approach, TCF4 does not modulate the improvement of positive or negative schizophrenia symptoms during treatment with antipsychotics. Finally, we have assessed a key electrophysiological endophenotype of schizophrenia, sensorimotor gating. As measured by prepulse inhibition, the schizophrenia risk allele C of TCF4 rs9960767 reduces sensorimotor gating.

Here, we investigated whether such stable TRCs can be identified and predicted by clinical baseline items. We analyzed data from an observational MDD cohort (Munich Antidepressant Response Signature [MARS] study, N = 1017), treated individually by psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic means, and a multicenter, partially randomized clinical/pharmacogenomic study (Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression [GENDEP], N = 809). Symptoms were evaluated up to week 16 (or discharge) in MARS and week 12 in GENDEP. Clustering was performed on 809 MARS patients (discovery sample) using a mixed model with the integrated completed likelihood criterion for the assessment of cluster stability, and validated through a distinct MARS validation sample and GENDEP. A random forest algorithm was used to identify prediction patterns based on 50 clinical baseline items. From the clustering of the MARS discovery sample, seven TRCs emerged ranging from fast and complete response (average 4.9 weeks until discharge, 94% remitted patients) to slow and incomplete response (10% remitted patients at week 16). These proved stable representations of treatment response dynamics in both the MARS and the GENDEP validation sample. TRCs were strongly associated with established response markers, particularly the rate of remitted patients at discharge. TRCs were predictable from clinical items, particularly personality items, life events, episode duration, and specific psychopathological features. Prediction accuracy improved significantly when cluster-derived slopes were modelled instead of individual slopes. In conclusion, model-based clustering identified distinct and clinically meaningful treatment response classes in MDD that proved robust with regard to capturing response profiles of differently designed studies. Response classes were predictable from clinical baseline characteristics. Conceptually, model-based clustering is translatable to any outcome measure and could advance the large-scale integration of studies on treatment efficacy or the neurobiology of treatment response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41398-019-0524-4,"Adult;Algorithms;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Clinical Decision Rules;Cluster Analysis;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Theoretical;Pharmacogenetics;Remission Induction;Treatment Outcome;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major",31383853,PMC6683145

The disease determines a significant disability due to a combination of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and rest tremor and non-motor symptoms such as sleep disorders, hallucinations, psychosis and compulsive behaviors. The current therapies consist in combination of drugs acting to control only the symptoms of the illness by the replacement of the dopamine lost. Although patients generally receive benefits from this symptomatic pharmacological management, they also show great variability in drug response in terms of both efficacy and adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic studies highlighted that genetic factors play a relevant influence in this drug response variability. In this review, we tried to give an overview of the recent progresses in the pharmacogenetics of PD, reporting the major genetic factors identified as involved in the response to drugs and highlighting the potential use of some of these genomic variants in the clinical practice. Many genes have been investigated and several associations have been reported especially with adverse drug reactions. However, only polymorphisms in few genes, including DRD2, COMT and SLC6A3, have been confirmed as associated in different populations and in large cohorts. The identification of genomic biomarkers involved in drug response variability represents an important step in PD treatment, opening the prospective of more personalized therapies in order to identify, for each person, the better therapy in terms of efficacy and toxicity and to improve the PD patients' quality of life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1007/s12017-017-8473-7,"Antiparkinson Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Biotransformation/genetics;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics/physiology;Dopamine/metabolism;Dopamine Agonists/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/physiology;Humans;Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/physiology;Parkinson Disease/*drug therapy/*genetics;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;Receptors, Dopamine/genetics/physiology;Treatment Outcome;Parkinson Disease",29305687,

Twenty children and adolescents underwent pharmacogenetic testing between June 2014 and May 2017. All children and adolescents were evaluated at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital-Majadahonda (Madrid, Spain). We report the proportion of patients achieving clinical improvement, amelioration of side effects, and changes in number of drugs. Data normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, and changes of pre- and post-pharmacogenetic testing were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test for paired samples. A two-sided p value threshold of 0.05 was considered for significance. Pharmacogenetic testing helped to improve the clinical outcome as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale in virtually all children (95%; 19 out of 20 children). The CGI improvement (CGI-I) was 2 (0.79) (range 1-4), 2.1 (0.56) (range 1-3), and 1.9 (0.99) (range 1-4) in foster and non-foster care children, respectively. Pharmacogenetic testing also helped to reduce the number of children using polypharmacy (from 65 to 45%), the mean number of drugs per children (from 3.3 to 2.4 drugs, p = 0.017), and self-reported relevant side effects (p = 0.006). Pharmacogenetic testing helped to improve the clinical outcome, and to reduce polypharmacy and the number of drugs used in children and adolescents with severe mental disorders. More evidence using robust (i.e., clinical trials) independent studies is required to properly determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic testing tools in children and adolescents with mental disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: children and adolescents",10.1007/s00702-018-1882-4,"Adolescent;Child;Child, Foster;*Decision Support Techniques;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/genetics/*prevention & control;Female;Humans;Male;Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Pharmacogenomic Testing/*standards;*Polypharmacy;Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index;Pharmacogenetics;Only Child;Mental Disorders",29626260,PMC6373261

The current study examined folate metabolism as a potential mechanism of CVD and neurocognitive deficits by: 1) using endothelial dysfunction as a biomarker of CVD, and 2) comparing enzymes associated with neurocognition, CVD, and critical to folate metabolism, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT). Endothelial function was assessed in 147 participants with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified grouped by MTHFR and COMT allele status. Regression models were used to compare neurocognitive performance based on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Overall, endothelial function predicted BACS composite z-scores after controlling for age, race, level of education, serum folate levels, and MTHFR/COMT risk allele status. Participants with at least one or more MTHFR and/or COMT risk alleles had lower BACS Composite and BACS Symbol Coding adjusted mean z-scores than those with both MTHFR CC and COMT Met/Met genotypes. Thus, endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the neurocognitive deficits seen in psychotic disorders. CVD interventions may not only reduce CVD-related morbidity, but also lessen progressive neurocognitive deficits reported in psychotic disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.schres.2015.02.006,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Analysis of Variance;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics;Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology;Female;Folic Acid/*blood;Gene Frequency;Genotype;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;*Psychotic Disorders/complications/drug therapy/genetics;Young Adult;Pharmacogenetics;Folic Acid;Psychotic Disorders",25728832,PMC4409513

The biological mechanisms behind antidepressant response are only partially known but genetic factors play a relevant role. A combined predictor across genetic variants may be useful to investigate this complex trait. METHODS: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were used to estimate multi-allelic contribution to: 1) antidepressant efficacy; 2) its overlap with MDD and schizophrenia. We constructed PRS and tested whether these predicted symptom improvement or remission from the GENDEP study (n=736) to the STAR*D study (n=1409) and vice-versa, including the whole sample or only patients treated with escitalopram or citalopram. Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for MDD and schizophrenia, we tested whether PRS from these disorders predicted symptom improvement in GENDEP, STAR*D, and five further studies (n=3756). RESULTS: No significant prediction of antidepressant efficacy was obtained from PRS in GENDEP/STAR*D but this analysis might have been underpowered. There was no evidence of overlap in the genetics of antidepressant response with either MDD or schizophrenia, either in individual studies or a meta-analysis. Stratifying by antidepressant did not alter the results. DISCUSSION: We identified no significant predictive effect using PRS between pharmacogenetic studies. The genetic liability to MDD or schizophrenia did not predict response to antidepressants, suggesting differences between the genetic component of depression and treatment response. Larger or more homogeneous studies will be necessary to obtain a polygenic predictor of antidepressant response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: secondary analysis",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.01.011,"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Humans;Male;Multifactorial Inheritance/*genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/genetics;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents",28159590,

The biallelic (5-HTTLPR) and triallelic (5-HTTLPR/rs25531) polymorphisms in SLC6A4 have been frequently investigated, but their associations with ADs response are in controversy. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to assess their modulation effect to ADs response in major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: We performed literature search in PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE before June 2019. Pooled analysis of genetic associations with response and remission, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were performed, and publication bias was assessed. RESULTS: Literature search yielded 49 eligible studies with 46 and 10 studies for biallelic and triallelic polymorphism, respectively. L allele of 5-HTTLPR was associated with both of response and remission rates. In the Caucasians using SSRIs only, carriers of LL/LS or LL genotype were more likely to be responders compared to SS carriers (LL/LS vs. SS: OR=1.55, 95%CI 1.20-2.00, p=0.001; LL vs. SS: OR=1.97, 95%CI 1.45-2.67, p<0.001). Similar associations were also found with remission rate. However, no effects on response or remission were found in the Asians or mixed/other antidepressant subgroups. Additionally, the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 triallelic polymorphism may not associate with ADs response. Meta-regression showed that percent of female in participants, year of publication and treatment duration modulated the association in Caucasians. CONCLUSION: 5-HTTLPR, instead of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 triallelic polymorphism, may exert as a marker for the prediction of response to SSRIs in Caucasians with MDD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.jad.2020.04.058,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Female;Genotype;Humans;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Depressive Disorder;Polymorphism, Genetic;Depressive Disorder, Major;Antidepressive Agents",32421611,

The selection process of antidepressant treatment is primarily guided by trial and error, and the outcomes with current antidepressant strategies are disappointing. The biological background of the disease is heterogeneous with presumably multiple biological systems involved. With the aim to individualize antidepressant treatment, multiple candidate gene and a few genome-wide association studies have been performed, but so far with very limited success. To address the dynamic changes of depressive symptoms and their response to treatment, recent studies focus on epigenetic mechanisms, as these are modulated by environmental stimuli and adaptive to different stages of the disorder. In the present paper, after a brief summary of the most important results from pharmacogenetic studies in MDD, we comment on the current and potential future value of genetic testing as a biomarker of response to antidepressant treatment.

One important assessment of validity is the ability to predict medication blood levels, which reflect altered metabolism. Historically, the metabolic impact of individual genes has been evaluated; however, we now know that multiple genes are often involved in medication metabolism. Here, we evaluated the ability of individual pharmacokinetic genes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and a combinatorial pharmacogenomic test (GeneSight Psychotropic®; weighted assessment of all three genes) to predict citalopram/escitalopram blood levels in patients with MDD. Patients from the Genomics Used to Improve DEpression Decisions (GUIDED) trial who were taking citalopram/escitalopram at screening and had available blood level data were included (N=191). In multivariate analysis of the individual genes and combinatorial pharmacogenomic test separately (adjusted for age, smoking status), the F statistic for the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test was 1.7 to 2.9-times higher than the individual genes, showing that it explained more variance in citalopram/escitalopram blood levels. In multivariate analysis of the individual genes and combinatorial pharmacogenomic test together, only the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test remained significant. Overall, this demonstrates that the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test was a superior predictor of citalopram/escitalopram blood levels compared to individual genes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113017,"Adult;Algorithms;Antidepressive Agents/*blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Citalopram/*blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/*genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics/metabolism;Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy/genetics;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Depressive Disorder;Citalopram;Depressive Disorder, Major",32485484,

During this period, the first antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers were all discovered. In the 1960s, the pharmacology of these drugs was elucidated and theories about the mechanisms of action proposed. In the 1970s and 1980s, new, more selective compounds were developed based on improved structure-activity relationships derived from in vitro receptor binding studies and animal models. These compounds entered clinical testing in the 1980s and began to be marketed in the late 1980s and 1990s. All of these agents were approved to treat psychiatric syndromes which are conditions defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms. None of these agents was developed based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of the illnesses being treated. None of these agents are curative and virtually all have limited clinical efficacy. In the earliest days of the modern era, there were few drugs available to combine and many had such broad actions that they were often marginally tolerated or unsafe when used in combination (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). With the advent of more medications, the frequency and extent of polypharmacy has exploded. In addition to simply having more drugs from which to select with different pharmacological profiles, many newer medications are also more selective in their pharmacological actions and thus are often better tolerated and safer when used in combination. In addition, there is the concern that the trade-off for more selective pharmacology may have been better tolerability at the expense of reduced efficacy, which clinicians then compensate for by using more medications in combination. For all of the above reasons, polypsychopharmacology has been present from the beginning of the modern era of psychopharmacotherapy and continues to be the rule rather than the exception. In fact, the frequency and the complexity of such polypsychopharmacology are both enormous and increasing. The percentage of patients being discharged from the Biological Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health on more than three psychiatric medications increased more than ten times between 1974-79, and 1990-95. The majority of patients seen in the Veterans Administration Medical System in the United States are on unique combinations of medications and the frequency and complexity of such polypharmacotherapy is increased in patients on psychiatric medications. Throughout the modern era, there have been attempts to determine whether there are populations of patients selectively responsible to specific agents (e.g. serotonin versus norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However, no compelling data have so far emerged. Instead, clinicians generally resort to combining drugs on the basis of symptoms such as psychosis and depression or anxiety and depression. Science has primarily informed the clinician about safety concerns rather than efficacy concerns when using such combinations. That will change in the future with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses which in turn will lead to improved therapies and the potential for more rationally derived combination treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1177/1359786806066070,Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/trends;Drug Therapy/*methods/trends;Forecasting;Humans;Informatics/*methods/trends;Pharmacogenetics/*methods/trends;Psychiatry/methods/trends;Psychopharmacology/methods/trends;Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use;Pharmacogenetics,16785276,

Although drug selection and dose adaptation according to cytochrome P450 genotypes are sound, a large number of patients need to be genotyped in order to prevent one case of severe side effect and/or nonresponse. The decrease in cost for genetic analysis shifts the cost: benefit ratio toward increasing use of pharmacogenetic tests.

As these variants have been implicated in common inflammatory/autoimmune processes, our findings strongly suggest that HLA-mediated low inflammatory background may contribute to the efficient response to Li in BD patients, while an inflammatory status overriding Li anti-inflammatory properties would favor a weak response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41598-021-97140-7,Adult;Alleles;Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Variation;Genotype;HLA-DQ beta-Chains/*genetics;HLA-DRB1 Chains/*genetics;Haplotypes;Humans;Lithium/*therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Treatment Outcome;Mood Disorders;HLA-G Antigens;HLA-C Antigens;HLA-D Antigens;HLA-A Antigens;HLA-B Antigens,34497278,PMC8426488

A common insertion-deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR) of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) gene has been frequently investigated for its association with antidepressant outcomes. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess 5-HTTLPR associations with antidepressants: (1) response in psychiatric disorders other than major depressive disorder (MDD) and (2) tolerability across all psychiatric disorders. Literature searches were performed up to January 2021, yielding 82 studies that met inclusion criteria, and 16 of these studies were included in the meta-analyses. Carriers of the 5-HTTLPR LL or LS genotypes were more likely to respond to antidepressant therapy, compared to the SS carriers in the total and European ancestry-only study populations. Long (L) allele carriers taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reported fewer ADRs relative to short/short (SS) carriers. European L carriers taking SSRIs had lower ADR rates than S carriers.

However, there is little information regarding pharmacogenetics of CLZ in patients with refractory psychosis and its clinical correlation with alcohol intake. Although neurological effects of CLZ in patients with concomitant alcohol intake are documented, its use is very common in patients with psychosis. We explored the impact of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 genetic variants on CLZ pharmacokinetics and side effects, along with coffee/alcohol/tobacco consumption habits and clinical data of 48 adult patients with refractory psychosis on CLZ antipsychotic monotherapy. Relevant CYP variants in CLZ metabolism were evaluated by targeted genotyping and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. CLZ and its main metabolite plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Biochemical and molecular data, along with other potential confounders, were included in the analysis by linear regression. Overall, CYP variants showed no effect on CLZ pharmacokinetics. The rs2069514 variant in homozygous genotype (also known as CYP1A2*1C/*1C) was associated with CLZ adverse reactions in Mexican patients with refractory psychosis (OR = 3.55 CI(95)  = 1.041-12.269, p = .043) and demonstrated that this effect is doubled by concomitant alcohol consumption (OR = 7.9 CI(95)  = 1.473-42.369, p = .016). Clinicians should be aware of this information before starting CLZ use, when treating patients with refractory psychosis, who are alcohol drinkers and carriers of this genetic variant in order to prevent CLZ-related adverse reactions.

There is growing enthusiasm for personalized medicine, relying on genetic variation as a contributor to heterogeneity of treatment effects. We sought to examine the relationship between a commercial pharmacogenetic test for psychotropic medications and 6-month cost of care and utilization in a large commercial health plan. METHODS: We performed a propensity-score matched case-control analysis of longitudinal health claims data from a large US insurer. Individuals with a mood or anxiety disorder diagnosis (N = 817) who received genetic testing for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variation were matched to 2,745 individuals who did not receive such testing. Outcomes included number of outpatient visits, inpatient hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and prescriptions, as well as associated costs over 6 months. RESULTS: On average, individuals who underwent testing experienced 40% fewer all-cause emergency room visits (mean difference 0.13 visits; P < 0.0001) and 58% fewer inpatient all-cause hospitalizations (mean difference 0.10 visits; P < 0.0001) than individuals in the control group. The two groups did not differ significantly in number of psychotropic medications prescribed or mood-disorder related hospitalizations.

The enzymes involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol include cytochrome P450 (CYP), carbonyl reductase and uridine diphosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase. The greatest proportion of the intrinsic hepatic clearance of haloperidol is by glucuronidation, followed by the reduction of haloperidol to reduced haloperidol and by CYP-mediated oxidation. In studies of CYP-mediated disposition in vitro, CYP3A4 appears to be the major isoform responsible for the metabolism of haloperidol in humans. The intrinsic clearances of the back-oxidation of reduced haloperidol to the parent compound, oxidative N-dealkylation and pyridinium formation are of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the same enzyme system is responsible for the 3 reactions. Large variation in the catalytic activity was observed in the CYP-mediated reactions, whereas there appeared to be only small variations in the glucuronidation and carbonyl reduction pathways. Haloperidol is a substrate of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor, as well as a stimulator, of CYP2D6. Reduced haloperidol is also a substrate of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of CYP2D6. Pharmacokinetic interactions occur between haloperidol and various drugs given concomitantly, for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, venlafaxine, buspirone, alprazolam, rifampicin (rifampin), quinidine and carteolol. Overall, drug interaction studies have suggested that CYP3A4 is involved in the biotransformation of haloperidol in humans. Interactions of haloperidol with most drugs lead to only small changes in plasma haloperidol concentrations, suggesting that the interactions have little clinical significance. On the other hand, the coadministration of carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin or quinidine affects the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol to an extent that alterations in clinical consequences would be expected. In vivo pharmacogenetic studies have indicated that the metabolism and disposition of haloperidol may be regulated by genetically determined polymorphic CYP2D6 activity. However, these findings appear to contradict those from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from studies of drug interactions in vivo. Interethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may explain these observations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2165/00003088-199937060-00001,Antipsychotic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism;Drug Interactions;Haloperidol/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology;Humans;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Pharmacogenetics;Haloperidol,10628896,

We have shown before that it is important to simultaneously analyze both pharmacokinetic factors such as the blood concentration and pharmacodynamic factors such as the site of drug action, when searching for genetic information that can be used to predict the treatment effects of fluvoxamine for depression and its side effects. For example, we have shown that there exists a specific concentration that can be used to predict remission in the treatment of depression with fluvoxamine (Fukui et al, 2008); however, it is considered that without a sufficient examination of such factors besides genetic information, it is difficult to predict the effects using just genetic information. On the other hand, the situation is more complex with medication for schizophrenia. Although it appears that consensus has been obtained in that the goal of medication for depression is remission, the goal of medication for schizophrenia is not clear and it cannot be said that prediction studies on the effects have been sufficiently conducted using genetic information. Therefore, at our facility, focusing on metabolic anomalies due to antipsychotics, QT prolongation, and hyperprolactinemia, which have become issues in recent years, a prediction study on side effects was conducted. Because such side effects can be quantified, in comparison with the effects study, it is advantageously simple to examine the relationship with genetic information. However, in the course of this study, we discovered that there was a gender difference in terms of glycolipid metabolic anomalies, that antipsychotics particularly extended the QT interval during nighttime, and that prolactine following the administration of antipsychotics temporally increased before declining again a few weeks later. We believe that when examining the relationship between side effects and genetic information, the genetic information may not be sufficiently utilized unless the analysis is performed after obtaining a better understanding of the characteristics of such side effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Female;Fluvoxamine/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Glycolipids/metabolism;Humans;Hyperprolactinemia/chemically induced;Long QT Syndrome/chemically induced;Male;Metabolic Syndrome/chemically induced;Middle Aged;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;*Precision Medicine;Receptors, Dopamine D2/genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Young Adult;Schizophrenia",20491281,

Its prognosis is uncertain and may result in a prolonged treatment that could extend throughout the entire lifespan of the patient. Antipsychotic drugs are characterized by a high interindividual variability when considering therapeutic effect and emergence of adverse effects. Such interindividual variability is thought to be associated primarily with pharmacokinetic matters. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of the application of the 5-Step Precision Medicine model (5SPM), an approach based on the pharmacogenetic analysis of the primary genes involved in the metabolism of the therapy for each patient, restructuring treatment as necessary. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-eight psychiatry patients were analysed for single nucleotide polymorphisms on genes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5 and ABCB1. Information on patients' diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, and hospitalizations was collected. RESULTS: We achieved a cost-benefit ratio of 3.31-3.59 with a reduction of direct cost (hospitalizations plus pharmacotherapy) with a reduction of total cost in 67% of the patients who underwent the clinical intervention. CONCLUSION: A rational Precision Medicine-based approach to psychiatric patients could result in a reduction on number of drugs required to control exacerbations, and the underlying pathologies, reducing the risk of adverse effects and improving adherence to treatment, leading to a potential decrease in direct costs.

However, few studies have examined the utility of PGX in other diagnoses typified by depression, or in veterans, a cohort with high rates of medical comorbidity, social stress, and suicide. AIM: To determine the efficacy of genetically guided pharmacological treatment of TRD. METHODS: We conducted an 8-week, prospective, multisite, single-blind study in 182 veterans with TRD including patients with BD, MDD, and PTSD. Subjects were randomly assigned to PGX-guided treatment in which the clinician incorporated PGX information into decision-making, or treatment as usual (TAU). RESULTS: Overall, the PGX group improved marginally faster compared to TAU, but the difference was not statistically significant. Secondary analyses revealed that only PTSD patients showed a potential benefit from PGX testing. Patients predicted by PGX testing to have moderate levels of genetic risk showed a significant benefit from the PGX-guided treatment, whereas other risk groups demonstrated no benefit. Clinicians generally found the PGX test was useful, particularly in more depressed patients and/or those with more warnings for significant or serious adverse outcomes.

Two decades of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies have attempted to identify key gene variants associated with antipsychotic response, with a dual goal of better understanding the mechanisms underlying drug response and guiding prescribing decisions in clinical care. Pharmacogenetic studies have succeeded in identifying several genes that are associated with antipsychotic treatment efficacy or side effects. However, the strength of these associations is modest and they are of limited clinical value. Genome-wide association studies, moving beyond hypothesis-based discovery, have greater potential to identify novel gene associations, although only a few genome-wide association studies have been conducted and they have not revealed clearly significant findings. The first pharmacogenetic tests to guide the selection or dosing of antipsychotic drugs are now commercially available. Their uptake has been limited by the modest level of prediction they offer, compounded by the lack of data supporting their clinical or economic benefits. Advances in genomic analysis techniques, the better characterization of larger subject cohorts and an improved understanding of the role of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions are renewing hope that future research will identify genetic variants with stronger associations with treatment outcome. Tests incorporating such genetic data, with environmental and clinical variables, may offer the potential to personalize medicine and significantly improve the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1586/ecp.11.16,"Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;*Comprehension;Humans;Pharmacogenetics/methods/*trends;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Treatment Outcome;Schizophrenia;Antipsychotic Agents",22114782,

The HPA axis is interrelated with glucocorticoid signaling via glucocorticoid receptors (GCRs). Thus, functional genetic variants on GCRs might influence therapeutic outcomes in depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between three functional polymorphisms (rs41423247, rs6195, and rs6189/rs6190) on GCR and response to fluoxetine in a group of depressed patients. One hundred newly diagnosed patients completed 6 weeks of fluoxetine treatment. Response to treatment was defined as a 50% decrease in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. Variants of rs41423247, rs6195, and rs6189/rs6190 polymorphisms were determined in extracted DNAs using PCR-RFLP method. Regarding rs41423247 polymorphism, carriers of the CG and GG genotype responded significantly better to fluoxetine compared with CC carriers (p=0.008, OR=3.3, 95% CI=1.35-8.07). Moreover, the G allele of rs41423247 polymorphism was strongly associated with response to fluoxetine (p=0.032, OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.09-4.44). There was no significant association between different genotypes and alleles of rs6195, rs6189/rs6190 variants, and response to fluoxetine (p=0.213 and 0.99, respectively). In conclusion, rs41423247 polymorphism might be a predictor for better response to fluoxetine. These findings support the idea that some variants of the GCR might contribute to interindividual variability of response to antidepressants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1176/appi.neuropsych.16120322,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Fluoxetine/*therapeutic use;Gene Frequency;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics;Fluoxetine;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder;Receptors, Glucocorticoid;Glucocorticoids",28641498,

A previous study found that increased C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, is associated with worse response to the serotonergic antidepressant escitalopram and better response to the noradrenergic antidepressant nortriptyline. It is unclear whether this reflects genetic disposition to inflammation. METHODS: We analyzed genotype data and weekly Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores (MADRS) from 755 unrelated individuals obtained over a 12-week period in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study. We calculated a polygenic risk score for CRP level based on genome-wide meta-analysis results from the CHARGE Consortium. RESULTS: A higher polygenic risk score for CRP was associated with slightly better response to escitalopram and slightly worse response to nortriptyline, reflected in a statistically significant interaction between polygenic risk score and drug (beta = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.26-1.87, p = 0.0093). DISCUSSION: A differential association between CRP-PRS and antidepressant drug that is in a direction opposite to that found with serum CRP measurement suggests that previously observed effect of inflammation on antidepressant efficacy may be driven by state factors distinct from genetic influences on systemic inflammation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,secondary analysis",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.08.011,"Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Adult;*C-Reactive Protein;Citalopram/pharmacology;*Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology;Female;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;*Inflammation/blood/genetics;Male;Meta-Analysis as Topic;Middle Aged;Nortriptyline/pharmacology;Pharmacogenetics/methods;Risk Assessment;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Inflammation;Antidepressive Agents",30130674,

In this emerging view, genetic findings, if considered individually, may have limited clinical applications. Thus, in recent years, combinations of information in several genes have been used for the selection of appropriate therapeutic doses and for the prediction of agranulocytosis, hyperlipidemia, and response to antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. While these tests based on multiple genes show greater predictive ability than individual allele tests, their net impact on clinical consequence and costs is limited, thus leading to limited penetration into widespread clinical use. As one looks at other branches of medicine, there are successful examples of pharmacogenetic tests guiding treatment, and thus, it is reasonable to hope that with the incorporation of clinical and environmental information and the identification of new genes drawn from genome-wide analysis, will improve the predictive utility of these tests leading to their increased use by clinicians.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1093/schbul/sbn114,"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Gene Expression/genetics;Genetic Testing;Humans;Pharmacogenetics/*methods;Phenotype;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Social Environment;Treatment Outcome;Pharmacogenetics",18753306,PMC2632495

The objective of the current meta-analysis was to determine if guidance from pharmacogenomic testing results in relatively higher rates of remission and response compared to treatment as usual (i.e., 'unguided' trial-and-error method) in adults with MDD. METHODS: Article databases were systematically searched from inception to December 2, 2017 for human studies assessing the clinical utility of pharmacogenomics in the acute treatment of MDD. Treatment outcomes in MDD may be defined continuously or categorically (i.e., response/remission). Herein, we delimit our focus on categorical outcomes. Using a random-effects model, data was pooled to determine the risk ratio (RR) of response and remission, respectively, in the pharmacogenomic-guided treatment group compared to the unguided group. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two open-label, controlled cohort studies were included. The pooled RR for treatment response comparing guided versus unguided treatment was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14 to 1.62; p = 0.0006; n = 799) in favour of guided treatment. The pooled RR for remission was 1.74 (95%CI = 1.09 to 2.77; p = 0.02, n = 735) also in favour of guided treatment. Heterogeneity in study results suggest that different genetic tests may variably impact response and remission rates.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis examining the relationship between COMT Val158Met and antipsychotic response. METHODS: Searches using PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases (03/01/2015) yielded 23 studies investigating COMT Val158Met variation and antipsychotic response in schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder.

To accomplish these goals, RNA-sequencing gene expression profiles of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were compared between BD Li responders and nonresponders with healthy controls before and after treatment. Several Li-responsive gene coexpression networks were discovered indicating widespread effects of Li on diverse cellular signaling systems including apoptosis and defense response pathways, protein processing and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Individual gene markers were also identified, differing in response to Li between BD responders and nonresponders, involved in processes of cell cycle and nucleotide excision repair that may explain part of the heterogeneity in clinical response to treatment. Results further indicated a Li gene expression signature similar to that observed with clonidine treatment, an α2-adrenoceptor agonist.

Thus, improvement in the use of antidepressant and antipsychotic therapy has to focus mainly on enhanced and more personalized treatment with the currently available drugs. One important aspect of such individualization is emphasizing interindividual differences in genes relevant to treatment, an area that can be termed neuropsychopharmacogenomics. Here, we review previous efforts to identify such critical genetic variants and summarize the results obtained to date. We conclude that most clinically relevant genetic variation is connected to phase I drug metabolism, in particular to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. To further improve individualized pharmacotherapy, there is a need to take both common and rare relevant mutations into consideration; we discuss the present and future possibilities of using whole genome sequencing to identify patient-specific genetic variation relevant to treatment in psychiatry. Translation of pharmacogenomic knowledge into clinical practice can be considered for specific drugs, but this requires education of clinicians, instructive guidelines, as well as full attention to polypharmacy and other clinically relevant factors. Recent large patient studies (n > 1,000) have replicated previous findings and produced robust evidence warranting the clinical utility of relevant genetic biomarkers. To further judge the clinical and financial benefits of preemptive genotyping in psychiatry, large prospective randomized trials are needed to quantify the value of genetic-based patient stratification in neuropsychopharmacotherapy and to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of such interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00094,Antipsychotic Agents;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents,32226396,PMC7080976

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE®, the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO through February 2017. We used prespecified criteria to select studies, abstract data, and rate internal validity and strength of the evidence (PROSPERO number CRD42016036358). RESULTS: We included two randomized trials (RCT), five controlled cohort studies, and six modeling studies of mostly women in their mid-40s with few comorbidities. CNSDose (ABCB1, ABCC1, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1) is the only pharmacogenomics test that significantly improved remission (one additional remitting patient in 12 weeks per three genotyped, 95% CI 1.7 to 3.5) and reduced intolerability in an RCT. ABCB1 genotyping leads to one additional remitting patient in 5 weeks per three genotyped (95% CI 3 to 20), but tolerability was not reported. In an RCT, GeneSight (CYP2D6, CYPC19, CYP1A2, SLC6A4, HTR2A) did not statistically significantly improve remission, and evidence is inconclusive about its tolerability. Evidence is generally low strength because RCTs were few and underpowered. Cost-effectiveness is unclear due to lack of directly observed cost-effectiveness outcomes. We found no studies that evaluated whether pharmacogenomics shortens time to optimal treatment, whether improvements were due to switches to genetically congruent medication, or whether effectiveness varies based on test and patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Certain pharmacogenomics tools show promise of improving short-term remission rates in women in their mid-40s with few comorbidities.

We genotyped the rs472660 and rs680055 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in N = 152 schizophrenia patients of European descent collected at two sample sites who were predominately treated with second generation antipsychotics for up to 6 months. Treatment response was assessed prospectively using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi square and analysis of covariance. The rs680055 SNP was significantly associated with treatment response. Carriers of the minor allele had significantly lower BPRS scores at study end (p = 5.9 × 10(-4)) with 8 % of the variance being explained by rs680055 genotype. Post hoc analyses revealed that this effect was present in both samples and in both genders. The rs472660 SNP was also associated with response (p = 0.027); however, this finding was not significant after multiple test correction. This is the first evidence that the rs680055 missense mutation influences antipsychotic response. Although our finding for rs472660 was only a non-significant trend after correction, our results still support the notion that this SNP may play a role in antipsychotic response. Despite the fact that the functional role of CYP3A43 in antipsychotic metabolism is not fully understood yet, our study provides an important contribution to understanding genetic factors of antipsychotic response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1007/s00702-014-1298-8,"Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Genetic Variation;Antipsychotic Agents",25150845,

Elucidating pharmacokinetic factors that explain this variability is important to increase treatment effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To examine potential modification of the relationship between paroxetine serum concentration (PSC) and serotonin transporter (SERT)-occupancy by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ABCB1 gene, coding for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump, in MDD patients. To investigate the relationship between ABCB1 SNPs and clinical response. METHODS: Patients had MDD and received paroxetine 20 mg/day. We measured PSC after 6 weeks. We quantified SERT-occupancy with SPECT imaging (n = 38) and measured 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17)-scores at baseline and after 6 weeks (n = 81). We genotyped ABCB1 at rs1045642 [3435C>T], rs1128503 [1236C>T], rs2032582 [2677G>T/A] and rs2235040 [2505G>A]. For our primary aim, we modeled mean SERT-occupancy in an Emax nonlinear regression model with PSC and assessed whether the model improved by genetic subgrouping. For our secondary aim, we used multivariate linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The rs1128503 and rs2032582 SNPs modified the relationship between PSC and SERT-occupancy in both our intention-to-treat and sensitivity analyses at the carriership level. However, we could not detect significant differences in clinical response between any of the genetic subgroups. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic influences of the ABCB1 rs1128503 and rs2032582 represent a potentially relevant pharmacogenetic mechanism to consider when evaluating paroxetine efficacy. Future studies are needed to support the role of ABCB1 genotyping for individualizing SSRI pharmacotherapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/YPG.0000000000000244,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism;Adult;Biomarkers, Pharmacological/blood;Depression/genetics/metabolism;Depressive Disorder, Major/*genetics/metabolism;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Paroxetine/analysis/blood/pharmacology;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/analysis/blood/genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Glycoproteins;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;P-Glycoproteins;P-Glycoprotein;Paroxetine",31634334,

Their actions on D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and the clinical outcome may be affected by polymorphisms. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: PRL-omas are well-differentiated endocrine tumors expressing DRD2. The dopamine-agonist cabergoline (CB), normalizes prolactin and reduces tumor size in about 80 - 90% of patients. DRD2 polymorphisms correlate with neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular alcoholism and schizophrenia. This review describes the DRD2 polymorphisms, their functional effects, and their impact on susceptibility and response to dopamine-agonists treatment. Searching PubMed database for pertinent articles we found that some DRD2 polymorphisms, particularly TaqIA, TaqIB and NcoI, are associated with different receptor binding in brain areas. One study carried out in patients with PRL-omas found a correlation between NcoI and TaqIA and resistance to CB. In particular, resistant patients had higher prevalence of NcoI-T allele than the responsive patients, while the commonest haplotype (having TaqIA2 allele) was associated with better response. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review deals with the connection between DRD2 polymorphisms and PRL-oma treatment and suggests hypotheses for further studies. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Only one study was carried out to analyze the role of DRD2 polymorphisms in PRLomas response to CB. Further studies, including pituitary and hypothalamus in vivo determination of DRD2 binding according to DRD2 genotypes, investigation of possible post-receptorial mechanisms involved, as well as population studies in collaboration with psychiatrists and neurologists, are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1517/17425250903352501,"Dopamine Agonists/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Genetic Variation;Humans;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Prolactinoma/*drug therapy/*genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*drug effects/*genetics;Receptors, Dopamine;Receptors, Dopamine D2;Prolactinoma",19929252,

There are currently no preventative or disease modifying treatments. All attempts to develop disease modifying drugs have failed. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has the potential to change the way new drugs are developed and the way drugs are prescribed. By using genetic markers that correlate with, and can therefore predict drug response, clinical trials can be designed to be enriched with individuals who are most likely to benefit from the drug, maximizing drug's efficacy, minimizing its adverse effects, and boosting the odds of successful drug discovery. Clinical application of PGx will help physicians to quickly and accurately determine the right drugs and the right doses for individuals, avoiding the lengthy trial and error approaches and adverse effects.

First messengers, second messengers, and gene expression all appear to be involved: the wide breadth of targets makes the lithium therapeutic path difficult to disentangle. In the present paper, we focused on the most direct biochemical lithium targets at therapeutic concentration, for which some pharmacogenetic finding is present (i.e. inositol mono phosphatase (IMPase), inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase (IPPase) and glycogen sinthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta)). They are all inhibited by lithium at therapeutic concentrations and are representative of the inositol depletion and of the GSK-3 beta based theories of lithium action. Then we surveyed gene variants on those targets that have been associated also with bipolar disorder. On the basis of the molecular characteristics of these proteins, we suggest a set of critical genetic variations. IMPase2, IPPase and GSK-3 beta gene appear to be good candidates for the analysis of lithium prophylactic efficacy and bipolar disorder phenotypes but the genetic association analysis conducted so far reported negative or not unequivocal finding. This may be due to the incomplete coverage of gene mutations in most studies or to the several actions that lithium is thought to perform and trigger in cell machinery, including receptors, calcium equilibrium, gene expression, activation of neuroprotective paths and other yet undetected or less considered mechanisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2174/092986709788186101,5'-Nucleotidase/*metabolism;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta;Humans;Inositol/metabolism;Lithium Compounds/*pharmacology;*Pharmacogenetics;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism;Lithium;Inositol;Pharmacogenetics,19442155,
Pharmacogenomics of antidepressant induced mania: a review and meta-analysis of the serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR) association.,2012,1,,Journal of affective disorders,1573-2517 (Electronic),136,1,e21-e29,Biernacka JM and McElroy SL and Crow S and Sharp A and Benitez J and Veldic M and Kung S and Cunningham JM and Post RM and Mrazek D and Frye MA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21680025/,eng,,Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressants can trigger a rapid mood switch from depression to mania. Identifying genetic risk factors associated with antidepressant induced mania (AIM) may enable individualized treatment strategies for bipolar depression. This review and meta-analysis evaluates the evidence for association between the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) and AIM. METHODS: Medline up to November 2009 was searched for key words bipolar, antidepressant, serotonin transporter, SLC6A4, switch, and mania. RESULTS: Five studies have evaluated the SLC6A4 promoter polymorphism and AIM in adults (total N=340 AIM+ cases, N=543 AIM- controls). Although a random effects meta-analysis showed weak evidence of association of the S allele with AIM+ status, a test of heterogeneity indicated significant differences in estimated genetic effects between studies. A similar weak association was observed in a meta-analysis based on a subset of three studies that excluded patients on mood stabilizers; however the result was again not statistically significant. LIMITATIONS: Few pharmacogenomic studies of antidepressant treatment of bipolar disorder have been published. The completed studies were underpowered and often lacked important phenotypic information regarding potential confounders such as concurrent use of mood stabilizers or rapid cycling. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient published data to confirm an association between 5HTTLPR and antidepressant induced mania. Pharmacogenomic studies of antidepressant induced mania have high potential clinical impact provided future studies are of adequate sample size and include rigorously assessed patient characteristics (e.g. ancestry, rapid cycling, concurrent mood stabilization, and length of antidepressant exposure).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.jad.2011.05.038,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects;Bipolar Disorder/*chemically induced/drug therapy/*genetics;Depression/drug therapy/genetics;Female;Humans;Male;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;Young Adult;Bipolar Disorder;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents",21680025,
Detection of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia and implications for antipsychotic therapy : is there a role for folate?,2013,2,,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,1179-2000 (Electronic),17,1,21-30,Burghardt KJ and Ellingrod VL,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23341251/,eng,,,"In general, the presence of metabolic syndrome is associated with significant cardiovascular mortality and represents a growing public health concern in the USA. Patients with schizophrenia have a three times greater risk of death than the general population, with cardiovascular disease being the most common cause of this mortality. Use of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) to treat schizophrenia contributes significantly to this cardiovascular risk. While several different clinical guidelines currently exist to monitor the metabolic consequences of AAP use, implementation is lacking. Because of under-monitoring of side effects and the lack of alternative treatment choices in schizophrenia, research has focused on identification of various biomarkers and pharmacogenomic targets to focus on the patients at greatest risk of metabolic syndrome, thus aiming to increase the efficacy and minimize the side effects of AAPs. This has led to several different lines of research. This review focuses on summarizing the differing metabolic syndrome criteria, monitoring guidelines for use of AAPs, and the role of folic acid as it relates to metabolic syndrome within the schizophrenia population. It concentrates not only on the pharmacogenomics of folic acid metabolism but also on its epigenetic interaction with the environment. From this work, genetic variation within both the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients treated with AAPs. Furthermore, work on the combination of folate pharmacogenetics and epigenetics has uncovered relationships between methylation, schizophrenia disease, treatment type, and metabolic syndrome. Despite several areas of biomarker research into schizophrenia-related metabolic syndrome, translation into the clinical setting is still lacking, and further studies are needed to bridge this gap. In the future, folate supplementation may prove to be an easy and effective clinical tool for prevention and/or treatment of metabolic syndrome associated with AAP treatment, but clearly more research needs to be done in this area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1007/s40291-013-0017-8,Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/prevention & control;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism;*Dietary Supplements;Epigenomics/methods;Folic Acid/*administration & dosage;Humans;Metabolic Syndrome/complications/*drug therapy;Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics/metabolism;Pharmacogenetics;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/complications/*drug therapy;Antipsychotic Agents;Schizophrenia;Folic Acid,23341251,PMC4077272

These pharmacogenetic strategies offer the prospect of identifying biological predictors of psychotropic drug response and could provide the means of determining the molecular substrates of drug efficacy and drug-induced adverse events. METHOD: The authors discuss methods issues in executing pharmacogenetic studies, review the first generation of pharmacogenetic studies of psychotropic drug response, and consider future directions for this rapidly evolving field. RESULTS: Pharmacogenetics has been most commonly used in studies of antipsychotic drug efficacy, antidepressant drug response, and drug-induced adverse effects. Data from antipsychotic drug studies indicate that polymorphisms within the serotonin 2A and dopamine receptor 2 genes may influence drug efficacy in schizophrenia. Moreover, a growing body of data suggests a relationship between the serotonin transporter gene and clinical effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression. A significant relationship between genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 system and drug-induced adverse effects may exist for certain medications. Finally, a number of independent studies point to a significant effect of a dopamine D(3) receptor polymorphism on susceptibility to tardive dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS: Initial research into the pharmacogenetics of psychotropic drug response suggests that specific genes may influence phenotypes associated with psychotropic drug administration. These results remain preliminary and will require further replication and validation.

These agents reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia, are effective in treatment refractory cases, and have a markedly lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. However, there is considerable patient-to-patient variability in therapeutic dose requirements of atypical antipsychotics and the propensity for side effects. Hence, the initial excitement since the introduction of atypical antipsychotics in late 1980s is now shifting towards a focus on individualization of pharmacotherapy and elucidation of the mechanistic basis of interindividual variability in drug response with use of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Pharmacogenomics, introduced in late 1990s, is the study of variability in drug response using information from the entire genome of a given individual patient. Both pharmacogenomics and conventional therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) share the similar goal of improving pharmacotherapy through better explanation of individual variability in drug response. Hence, pharmacogenomic biomarkers offer a unique opportunity to complement and expand the scope of traditional TDM in clinical psychopharmacology. Importantly, pharmacogenomics enables the investigation of factors distal to drug exposure in the plasma compartment (e.g. drug targets at the biophase), thereby providing a more complete portrayal of sources of variability in psychotropic drug response. We discuss (1). the definitions for biomarkers and surrogate endpoints in the context of pharmacogenomics, (2). genetic variations in isozyme-specific atypical antipsychotic metabolism in vivo, (3). selected examples of pharmacogenomic variability in pertinent drug targets and, (4). the anticipated roadmap from implementation of pharmacogenomics to changes in healthcare and therapeutic policy.

As pharmacogenetics is one of the key tools of precision psychiatry, we analyze the cost-utility of test screening of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 for patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) and try to understand the main drivers that influence the cost-utility. METHODS: We developed two pharmacoeconomic nonhomogeneous Markov models to test the cost-utility, from an Italian societal perspective, of pharmacogenetic testing genetic to characterize the metabolizing profiles of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2D6 in a hypothetical case study of patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). The model considers different scenarios of adjustment of antidepressant treatment according to the patient's metabolizing profile or treatment over a period of 18 weeks. The uncertainty of model parameters is tested through both a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis, and these results are used in a post-hoc analysis to understand the main drivers of three alternative cost-effectiveness levels (""poor,"" ""standard,"" and ""high""). These drivers are first evaluated from an exploratory multidimensional perspective and next from a predictive perspective as the probability that a patient belongs to a specific cost-effectiveness level is estimated on the basis of a restricted set of parameters used in the original pharmacoeconomic model. RESULTS: The models for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 indicate that screening has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 60,000€ and 47,000€ per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the treatments are cost-effective for a 75,000€ willingness to pay (WTP) threshold in 58% and 63% of the Monte Carlo replications, respectively. The post-hoc analysis highlights the factors that allow us to clearly discriminates poor cost-effectiveness from high cost-effectiveness scenarios and demonstrates that it is possible to predict with reasonable accuracy the cost-effectiveness of a genetic test and the associated therapeutic pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that screenings for both CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 enzymes for patients with MDD are cost-effective for a WTP threshold of 75,000€ per QALY, and provide relevant suggestions about the most important aspects to be further explored in clinical studies aimed at addressing the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing for patients diagnosed with MDD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: cost-efficacy analysis",10.1007/s40261-022-01182-2,"Cost-Benefit Analysis;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics;Humans;Italy;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Pharmacogenetics",35930170,PMC9427916

The results of these investigations were encouraging when examining patient-outcome improvement. Furthermore, a nine-serum biomarker panel (including BDNF, cortisol and soluble TNF-α receptor type II) showed good sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between MDD and healthy controls. These first diagnostic and response-predictive tests for MDD provided a source of optimism for future clinical applications.

In this study, we examined the prevalence and potential genetic predictors of metabolic side effects in 60 adult patients on clozapine. METHOD: Genetic variants of relevance to clozapine metabolism, clearance, and response were assessed through targeted genotyping of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, the efflux transporter ABCB1, the serotonin receptor (HTR2C), leptin (LEP), and leptin receptor (LEPR). Clozapine levels and other potential confounders, including concurrent medications, were also included in the analysis. RESULTS: More than half of the patients were obese (51%), had metabolic syndrome (52.5%), and 30.5% were overweight. There was a high prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy (61.9%). With multivariable linear regression analysis, LEP -2548G>A, LEPR c.668A>G, and HTR2C c.551-3008 C>G were identified as genetic predictors of body mass index (BMI) after considering effects of clozapine dose, blood level, and concurrent medications (adjusted R(2) = 0.305). Metabolic syndrome was found to be significantly associated with clozapine level and CYP2C19*2 and LEPR c.668 G alleles. Clozapine levels in patients with metabolic syndrome were significantly higher compared to those without metabolic syndrome (1886 ± 895 vs. 1283 ± 985 ng/mL, P < 0.01) and were associated with the CYP2C19*2 genotype. No association was found between the genetic variants studied and lipid or glucose levels. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a high prevalence of metabolic side effects with clozapine and suggests higher clozapine level and pharmacogenetic markers in CYP2C19, LEP, LEPR, and HTR2C receptors as important predictors of BMI and metabolic syndrome.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0706743716670128,Adult;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Clozapine/*adverse effects;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology/*genetics;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Obesity/chemically induced/genetics;Overweight/*chemically induced/genetics;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;Prevalence;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Young Adult;Clozapine,27681143,PMC5298525

Thus, the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics have been aimed at providing genetic components of this inter-individual variability in antipsychotic response in order to establish an individually-based pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia and to elucidate the mechanism of antipsychotic response so as to solve the refractoriness of schizophrenia. Pharmacogenetics, which is defined as the science of pharmacological response and its modification by hereditary influence can be divided into two categories: the genetic background of pharmacokinetics, i.e. the absorption, distribution, tissue localization, biotransformation and excretion of drugs, and pharmacodynamics, i.e. the biochemical and physiological consequences of a drug and its mechanism of action. Pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics has been focused mainly on the association between genetic polymorphisms in CYP genes, including CYP2D6, and the metabolism of these drugs. Polymorphism in CYP2D6 enables a division of individuals within a given population into at least two groups, i.e. poor metabolizers (PMs), extensive metabolizers (EMs), and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) of certain drugs. PMs have higher plasma concentrations of and more adverse effects from antipsychotics. UMs could be one of the important factors that induce treatment-refractoriness to antipsychotics. Genetic polymorphisms in serotonin and dopamine receptors that have a high affinity for antipsychotics have so far been extensively investigated in the pharmacodynamics of this type of drug. Not just one gene but multiple genes play a role in complex phenotypes, including the clinical response to medication. Thus, a multiple candidate genes approach has recently been adopted in the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics. The new field of pharmacogenomics using DNA microarray analysis, which focuses on the genetic determinants of drug response at the level of the entire human genome, is important for development and prescription of safer and more effective individually-tailored antipsychotics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",,"Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*pharmacokinetics;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics;Dopamine/metabolism;Humans;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;*Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Genetic;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Serotonin/metabolism;Pharmacogenetics",15279062,

Unfortunately, several important side effects that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The two most common are abnormal involuntary movements (tardive dyskinesia) and weight gain progressing through diabetes to metabolic syndrome. A more rare and life-threatening adverse effect is clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA), which has been linked to clozapine use. Clozapine itself has a unique position among antipsychotic medications, representing the treatment of choice in refractory schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the potential risk of agranulocytosis, albeit small, prevents the widespread use of clozapine. Very few genetic determinants have been clearly associated with CIA due to small sample sizes and lack of replication in subsequent studies. The HLA system has been the main hypothesized region of interest in the study of CIA, and several gene variants in this region have been implicated, particularly variants of the HLA-DQB1 locus. A preliminary genome-wide association study has been conducted on a small sample for CIA, and a signal from the HLA region was noted.

This review uncovered 51 papers examining the use of PGSs for drug-related outcomes, with the majority of these papers focusing on the treatment of psychiatric disorders (n = 30). Due to difficulties in collecting large cohorts of uniformly treated patients, the majority of pharmacogenomic PGSs were derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies of disease phenotypes that were related to the pharmacogenomic phenotypes under investigation (e.g., schizophrenia-derived PGSs for antipsychotic response prediction). Examination of the research participants included in these studies revealed that the majority of cohort participants were of European descent (78.4%). These biases were also reflected in research affiliations, which were heavily weighted towards institutions located in Europe and North America, with no first or last authors originating from institutions in Africa or South Asia. There was also substantial variability in the methods used to develop PGSs, with between 3 and 6.6 million variants included in the PGSs. Finally, we observed significant inconsistencies in the reporting of PGS analyses and results, particularly in terms of risk model development and application, coupled with a lack of data transparency and availability, with only three pharmacogenomics PGSs deposited on the Polygenic Score Catalog.

The neurotrophin hypothesis of depression and antidepressant drug action postulates that reduced activity of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of major depression, and that its restoration may represent a critical mechanism underlying antidepressant therapeutic effect. This hypothesis is supported by numerous animal studies; however, evidence from clinical studies is lacking. This study is the first to use both single-marker as well as haplotype analysis to test the effect of genetic variants of BDNF on the therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatment in mood disorder. Among eight BDNF TagSNPs tested, one allele (rs908867) is associated with antidepressant response, with heterozygote carriers showing a better response than homozygous analog. The authors also identified a haplotype associated with the therapeutic response. This study provides clinical evidence to support the role of BDNF in antidepressant therapeutic mechanisms. However, further work is needed to confirm the findings, for several reasons. First, the study included not only major depression but also bipolar disorder patients; second, various antidepressants were used in this study, which could affect patients' responses; third, the frequency of the haplotype associated with treatment response is rare; and fourth, previous studies of the effects of single BDNF polymorphisms on antidepressant action have reported conflicting findings.

Recently, it has been suggested that SNPs can be used for homogeneity testing and pharmacogenetic studies and to identify and map complex, common diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Consistent with this proposal is the identification of the patterns of SNPs in conditions such as diabetes, schizophrenia, and blood-pressure homeostasis. Although these studies have provided insight into the nature of human sequence variation, it is not known at present whether these variations are truly significant toxicologically and pharmacologically. Moreover, it is possible that most complex, common disorders are caused by the combined effects of multigenes and nongenetic environmental factors (multifactorial). Therefore, it is likely that sequence variation alone is not sufficient to predict the risk of disease susceptibility, particularly in homeostatic organisms like humans. Nevertheless, these variants may provide a starting point for further inquiry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1007/s100380200086,"Chromosome Mapping;*Evolution, Molecular;*Genetic Diseases, Inborn;Genetic Markers;*Genome, Human;Humans;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Humanities;Humanism;Alleles;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",12436191,

Single marker analysis using PLINK identified 12 SNPs associated with cancer (P< 0.05); especially, SNP rs6532496 revealed the strongest association with cancer (P = 6.84 × 10⁻³); while the next best signal was rs951613 (P = 7.46 × 10⁻³). Classic logistic regression in PROC GENMOD showed that both rs6532496 and rs951613 revealed strong gene-steroid interaction effects (OR=2.18, 95% CI=1.31-3.63 with P = 2.9 × 10⁻³ for rs6532496 and OR=2.07, 95% CI=1.24-3.45 with P = 5.43 × 10⁻³ for rs951613, respectively).

It is reasonable to suggest a genetic contribution to these inter-individual differences. Thus, pharmacogenetic approaches could provide the clinician with tools to individualize pharmacotherapy. In this paper, published reports that address the genetic basis of response to antidepressant drugs and mood-stabilizing drugs are selectively reviewed. There is substantial support for the assumption that genetic factors play a role in response to lithium and a degree of support for a role of such factors in response to antidepressants. Based on a Medline search and access to papers accepted but not yet published, studies on the role of specific candidate genes are comprehensively evaluated. A number of studies from different groups point to a role for polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene in the therapeutic response to specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors. There are reports of other candidate genes, particularly in the serotonergic system, but these have still to be replicated. There is little evidence thus far that points to a role for specific candidate genes in response to mood-stabilizing drugs. Future research directions including the selection of relevant candidate genes, pivotal issues in the design of studies and high throughput methods of analysis are discussed in the light of the findings. Although pharmacogenetic approaches have great potential in the treatment of major depression and bipolar disorder, substantial further research is needed. Careful attention needs to be paid to research design issues and potential confounding factors such as population stratification. High throughput, genome-wide approaches could greatly accelerate the acquisition of relevant data but their success is dependent on the availability of appropriate clinical samples.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1017/S1461145702002936,Affect/*drug effects;Animals;Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology;Case-Control Studies;Depressive Disorder/*genetics;Genome;Humans;Lithium/pharmacology;Mood Disorders/drug therapy/genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;Research Design;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents,12366879,

We examined 86 first episode patients (schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with psychotic features) who had minimal to no prior antipsychotic exposure in a 6-week pharmacogenomic study of antipsychotic treatment response. Response was measured by change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score. Risperidone monotherapy was the primary antipsychotic treatment. Pharmacogenomic association studies were completed to (1) examine candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes known to be involved with glutamate signaling, and (2) conduct an exploratory genome-wide association study of symptom response to identify potential novel associations for future investigation. Two SNPs in GRM7 (rs2069062 and rs2014195) were significantly associated with antipsychotic response in candidate gene analysis, as were two SNPs in the human glutamate receptor delta 2 (GRID2) gene (rs9307122 and rs1875705) in genome-wide association analysis. Further examination of these findings with those from a separate risperidone-treated study sample demonstrated that top SNPs in both studies were overrepresented in glutamate genes and that there were similarities in neurodevelopmental gene categories associated with drug response from both study samples. These associations indicate a role for gene variants related to glutamate signaling and antipsychotic response with more broad association patterns indicating the potential importance of genes involved in neuronal development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/tp.2016.10,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics;Receptors, Glutamate/*genetics;Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate/*genetics;Risperidone/therapeutic use;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/genetics;Young Adult;Antipsychotic Agents;Pharmacogenetics;Glutamic Acid;Psychotic Disorders;Glutamates",26905411,PMC4872428

We did this using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus2 microarrays in blood samples, from untreated individuals with MDD (N=63) ascertained at a community outpatient clinic, pre and post 8-week treatment with citalopram, and used a regression model to assess the impact of gene expression differences on antidepressant response.

A total of 32 probesets were differentially expressed according to response to citalopram treatment following false discovery rate correction. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) was the most significant differentially expressed gene and its expression was upregulated by citalopram treatment in individuals who responded to treatment. We found these results to be concordant with our observation of decreased expression of IRF7 in the prefrontal cortex of MDDs with negative toxicological evidence for antidepressant treatment at the time of death.

Its incidence is particularly high in people with overt or un(der)diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Objective and precise identification of individuals at risk, ways of monitoring response to treatments and novel preventive therapeutics need to be discovered, employed and widely deployed. We sought to investigate whether blood gene expression biomarkers for suicide (that is, a 'liquid biopsy' approach) can be identified that are more universal in nature, working across psychiatric diagnoses and genders, using larger cohorts than in previous studies. Such markers may reflect and/or be a proxy for the core biology of suicide. We were successful in this endeavor, using a comprehensive stepwise approach, leading to a wealth of findings. Steps 1, 2 and 3 were discovery, prioritization and validation for tracking suicidality, resulting in a Top Dozen list of candidate biomarkers comprising the top biomarkers from each step, as well as a larger list of 148 candidate biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction in the validation step. Step 4 was testing the Top Dozen list and Bonferroni biomarker list for predictive ability for suicidal ideation (SI) and for future hospitalizations for suicidality in independent cohorts, leading to the identification of completely novel predictive biomarkers (such as CLN5 and AK2), as well as reinforcement of ours and others previous findings in the field (such as SLC4A4 and SKA2). Additionally, we examined whether subtypes of suicidality can be identified based on mental state at the time of high SI and identified four potential subtypes: high anxiety, low mood, combined and non-affective (psychotic). Such subtypes may delineate groups of individuals that are more homogenous in terms of suicidality biology and behavior. We also studied a more personalized approach, by psychiatric diagnosis and gender, with a focus on bipolar males, the highest risk group. Such a personalized approach may be more sensitive to gender differences and to the impact of psychiatric co-morbidities and medications. We compared testing the universal biomarkers in everybody versus testing by subtypes versus personalized by gender and diagnosis, and show that the subtype and personalized approaches permit enhanced precision of predictions for different universal biomarkers. In particular, LHFP appears to be a strong predictor for suicidality in males with depression. We also directly examined whether biomarkers discovered using male bipolars only are better predictors in a male bipolar independent cohort than universal biomarkers and show evidence for a possible advantage of personalization. We identified completely novel biomarkers (such as SPTBN1 and C7orf73), and reinforced previously known biomarkers (such as PTEN and SAT1). For diagnostic ability testing purposes, we also examined as predictors phenotypic measures as apps (for suicide risk (CFI-S, Convergent Functional Information for Suicidality) and for anxiety and mood (SASS, Simplified Affective State Scale)) by themselves, as well as in combination with the top biomarkers (the combination being our a priori primary endpoint), to provide context and enhance precision of predictions. We obtained area under the curves of 90% for SI and 77% for future hospitalizations in independent cohorts. Step 5 was to look for mechanistic understanding, starting with examining evidence for the Top Dozen and Bonferroni biomarkers for involvement in other psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders, as a mechanism for biological predisposition and vulnerability. The biomarkers we identified also provide a window towards understanding the biology of suicide, implicating biological pathways related to neurogenesis, programmed cell death and insulin signaling from the universal biomarkers, as well as mTOR signaling from the male bipolar biomarkers. In particular, HTR2A increase coupled with ARRB1 and GSK3B decreases in expression in suicidality may provide a synergistic mechanistical corrective target, as do SLC4A4 increase coupled with AHCYL1 and AHCYL2 decrease. Step 6 was to move beyond diagnostics and mechanistical risk assessment, towards providing a foundation for personalized therapeutics. Items scored positive in the CFI-S and subtypes identified by SASS in different individuals provide targets for personalized (psycho)therapy. Some individual biomarkers are targets of existing drugs used to treat mood disorders and suicidality (lithium, clozapine and omega-3 fatty acids), providing a means toward pharmacogenomics stratification of patients and monitoring of response to treatment. Such biomarkers merit evaluation in clinical trials. Bioinformatics drug repurposing analyses with the gene expression biosignatures of the Top Dozen and Bonferroni-validated universal biomarkers identified novel potential therapeutics for suicidality, such as ebselen (a lithium mimetic), piracetam (a nootropic), chlorogenic acid (a polyphenol) and metformin (an antidiabetic and possible longevity promoting drug). Finally, based on the totality of our data and of the evidence in the field to date, a convergent functional evidence score prioritizing biomarkers that have all around evidence (track suicidality, predict it, are reflective of biological predisposition and are potential drug targets) brought to the fore APOE and IL6 from among the universal biomarkers, suggesting an inflammatory/accelerated aging component that may be a targetable common denominator.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1038/mp.2017.128,"Adult;Anxiety Disorders/psychology;Biomarkers/blood;Bipolar Disorder/psychology;Depression/psychology;Female;Gene Expression/genetics;Genomics/methods;Humans;Male;Precision Medicine/*methods;Risk Assessment/*methods;Risk Factors;Suicidal Ideation;Suicide/prevention & control/*psychology;Suicide, Attempted/psychology;Suicide",28809398,PMC5582166

This review explored response to atypical antipsychotics among Blacks compared with other groups to assess systematic variation that may contribute to disparities. METHODS: We conducted a quasi-systematic review of studies reporting response to atypical antipsychotics among Blacks compared with other groups, including effects of genetic variation. RESULTS: Of 48 identified research articles, 29 assessed differences in outcomes without inclusion of genetic variation and 20 explored effects of genetic variation; of note: one article included both types of data. Analysis of the 29 papers with clinical outcomes only suggests that while data on efficacy and risk of movement disorders were heterogeneous, findings indicate increased risk of metabolic effects and neutropenia among Blacks. Of the 20 articles exploring effects of genetic variation, allelic or genotypic variations involving several genes were associated with altered efficacy or safety among Blacks but not Whites, including risk of decreased response involving variation in DRD4 and DRD1, and improved efficacy associated with variants in DRD2, COMT, and RGS4. Others showed significant improvement in treatment response only among Whites, including variation in DTNBP1, DRD4, and GNB3. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis can help tailor management among Blacks using an atypical antipsychotic. Heterogeneity in genetic variation effects and response allele frequency suggests that pharmacogenetics approaches for atypical antipsychotics will need to explicitly incorporate race and ethnicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.18865/ed.30.S1.229,"African Americans/psychology/*statistics & numerical data;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;*Health Status Disparities;Humans;Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Treatment Outcome;United States;Antipsychotic Agents;African Continental Ancestry Group",32269465,PMC7138445

DATA SOURCES: The following electronic databases were searched for relevant published literature: Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, EMBASE, Health Technology Assessment database, ISI Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Economic Evaluation Database, Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry and the Centre for Health Economics website. In addition, publicly available information on various genotyping tests was sought from the internet and advisory panel members. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of CYP testing was undertaken. Data were extracted into structured tables and narratively discussed, and meta-analysis was undertaken when possible. A review of economic evaluations of CYP testing in psychiatry and a review of economic models related to schizophrenia were also carried out. RESULTS: For analytical validity, 46 studies of a range of different genotyping tests for 11 different CYP polymorphisms (most commonly CYP2D6) were included. Sensitivity and specificity were high (99-100%). For clinical validity, 51 studies were found. In patients tested for CYP2D6, an association between genotype and tardive dyskinesia (including Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores) was found. The only other significant finding linked the CYP2D6 genotype to parkinsonism. One small unpublished study met the inclusion criteria for clinical utility. One economic evaluation assessing the costs and benefits of CYP testing for prescribing antidepressants and 28 economic models of schizophrenia were identified; none was suitable for developing a model to examine the cost-effectiveness of CYP testing. CONCLUSIONS: Tests for determining genotypes appear to be accurate although not all aspects of analytical validity were reported. Given the absence of convincing evidence from clinical validity studies, the lack of clinical utility and economic studies, and the unsuitability of published schizophrenia models, no model was developed; instead key features and data requirements for economic modelling are presented.

Most mental and many neurological disorders have a compiled multifaceted nature, which may be the reason why this endeavor has hitherto not been very successful. This is also true for tardive dyskinesia (TD), an involuntary movement complication of long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs. The observed associations of specific gene variants with the prevalence and severity of a disorder can also be applied to try to elucidate the pathogenesis of the condition. In this paper, this strategy is used by combining pharmacogenetic knowledge with theories on the possible role of a dysfunction of specific cellular elements of neostriatal parts of the (dorsal) extrapyramidal circuits: various glutamatergic terminals, medium spiny neurons, striatal interneurons and ascending monoaminergic fibers. A peculiar finding is that genetic variants which would be expected to increase the neostriatal dopamine concentration are not associated with the prevalence and severity of TD. Moreover, modifying the sensitivity to glutamatergic long-term potentiation (and excitotoxicity) shows a relationship with levodopa-induced dyskinesia, but not with TD. Contrasting this, TD is associated with genetic variants that modify vulnerability to oxidative stress. Reducing the oxidative stress burden of medium spiny neurons may also be the mechanism behind the protective influence of 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. It is probably worthwhile to discriminate between neostriatal matrix and striosomal compartments when studying the mechanism of TD and between orofacial and limb-truncal components in epidemiological studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2217/pgs-2019-0100,"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Dopamine/genetics/metabolism;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/*genetics/pathology;Excitatory Amino Acid Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Humans;Neostriatum/drug effects/pathology;Oxidative Stress/*drug effects;Pharmacogenetics;Pyramidal Cells/drug effects/pathology;Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT2/genetics;Schizophrenia/complications/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology;Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Spinal Cord/drug effects/pathology;Tardive Dyskinesia/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology;Schizophrenia;Movement Disorders",31686592,

Pharmacogenomic predictors of these adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have yet to be identified. We sought to determine the contribution of both common and rare genetic variation to psychiatric and behavioral ADRs associated with LEV. METHODS: This case-control study compared cases of LEV-associated behavioral disorder (n = 149) or psychotic reaction (n = 37) to LEV-exposed people with no history of psychiatric ADRs (n = 920). All samples were of European ancestry. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis comparing those with LEV ADRs to controls. We estimated the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and compared cases with LEV-associated psychotic reaction to controls. Rare variant burden analysis was performed using exome sequence data of cases with psychotic reactions (n = 18) and controls (n = 122). RESULTS: Univariate GWAS found no significant associations with either LEV-associated behavioural disorder or LEV-psychotic reaction. PRS analysis showed that cases of LEV-associated psychotic reaction had an increased PRS for schizophrenia relative to contr ols (p = .0097, estimate = .4886). The rare-variant analysis found no evidence of an increased burden of rare genetic variants in people who had experienced LEV-associated psychotic reaction relative to controls. SIGNIFICANCE: The polygenic burden for schizophrenia is a risk factor for LEV-associated psychotic reaction. To assess the clinical utility of PRS as a predictor, it should be tested in an independent and ideally prospective cohort. Larger sample sizes are required for the identification of significant univariate common genetic signals or rare genetic signals associated with psychiatric LEV ADRs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1111/epi.17228,Anticonvulsants/adverse effects;Case-Control Studies;*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Levetiracetam/adverse effects;Pharmacogenetics;Prospective Studies,35298028,PMC9321556
Pharmacogenetic testing for the guidance of psychiatric treatment: a multicenter retrospective analysis.,2017,8,,CNS spectrums,1092-8529 (Print),22,4,315-324,Espadaler J and Tuson M and Lopez-Ibor JM and Lopez-Ibor F and Lopez-Ibor MI,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27098095/,eng,,United States,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between clinical outcome and the recommendations of a pharmacogenetic test (Neuropharmagen) in patients with a variety of psychiatric conditions whose previous treatment regimen had failed. METHODS: This retrospective, naturalistic, multicenter study included adult psychiatric patients (depression, psychosis, anxiety, bipolar, etc.) who had been seen at 3 private clinics. All patients had received pharmacogenetic testing (Neuropharmagen) and were classified depending on whether or not their post-test treatment regimen followed the test recommendations. Clinical severity was assessed with the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) at baseline (pre-test) and 3-month follow-up, and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: 182 patients were available for analysis. After multivariate adjustment, patients whose treatment followed the test recommendations had odds of improvement about 4 times greater than patients whose treatment did not follow the recommendations (adjusted OR=3.86, 95%CI 1.36-10.95; p=0.011). Importantly, psychiatric diagnosis did not significantly affect the odds of improvement. Also, in the subpopulation with baseline CGI-S score >3 (N=170), the rate of stabilization at follow-up (defined as CGI-S≤3) was significantly higher in patients whose treatment followed the pharmacogenetic recommendations (p=0.033). There was no apparent difference in the incidence of adverse events (6 patients in each group). CONCLUSIONS: Non-drug naïve patients whose treatment followed the recommendations of pharmacogenetic testing were more likely to improve their condition than patients whose treatment did not. These results are consistent with previous clinical research on depressed patients, and this study also suggests that this benefit can be extended to psychiatric conditions other than depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S1092852915000711,Adult;Anti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Antimanic Agents/therapeutic use;Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy;Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy;Depressive Disorder/drug therapy;Humans;Male;Mental Disorders/*drug therapy;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;*Precision Medicine;Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy;Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use;Retrospective Studies;Severity of Illness Index;Spain;Treatment Outcome;Pharmacogenetics,27098095,

A negative correlation between NSS intensity and GPX activity was specifically found in the S(FE) patients. The data in this report argue that a reduction of GPX activity might be one of the causes for the emergence of NSS at the onset of schizophrenia, and provide the evidence that antipsychotic therapy can attenuate activity reductions of SOD and CAT, but not the activity reduction of GPX and the intensity of NSS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.psychres.2018.09.009,Adult;Antioxidants/*metabolism;Biomarkers/blood;Female;Glutathione Peroxidase/blood;Humans;Male;*Neuropsychological Tests;Oxidative Stress/physiology;Schizophrenia/*blood/*diagnosis/enzymology;*Schizophrenic Psychology;Superoxide Dismutase/blood;Young Adult;Enzyme Activators;Enzyme Activation;Antioxidants,30273900,

Genetic variants in cytochrome P450 (CYP), dopamine receptor (DRD2, DRD3), serotonin receptor (HTR2A, HTR2C) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (ABCB1) genes, among others, were previously associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antipsychotic drugs. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of aripiprazole and olanzapine on pupillary light reflex related to pharmacogenetics. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers receiving 5 oral doses of 10 mg aripiprazole and 5 mg olanzapine tablets were genotyped for 46 polymorphisms by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Pupil examination was performed by automated pupillometry. Aripiprazole, dehydro-aripiprazole and olanzapine plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Aripiprazole affected pupil contraction: it caused dilatation after the administration of the first dose, then caused constriction after each dosing. It induced changes in all pupillometric parameters (P < .05). Olanzapine only altered minimum pupil size (P = .046). Polymorphisms in CYP3A, HTR2A, UGT1A1, DRD2 and ABCB1 affected pupil size, the time of onset of constriction, pupil recovery and constriction velocity. Aripiprazole, dehydro-aripiprazole and olanzapine pharmacokinetics were significantly affected by polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP3A, CYP1A2, ABCB1 and UGT1A1 genes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, aripiprazole and its main metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole altered pupil contraction, but olanzapine did not have such an effect. Many polymorphisms may influence pupillometric parameters and several polymorphisms had an effect on aripiprazole, dehydro-aripiprazole and olanzapine pharmacokinetics.

Cytochrome p450 phenotyping/genotyping in patients receiving antipsychotics: useful aid to prescribing?,2002,,,Clinical pharmacokinetics,0312-5963 (Print),41,7,453-70,Dahl ML,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12083975/,eng,,Switzerland,"Many antipsychotics, including perphenazine, zuclopenthixol, thioridazine, haloperidol and risperidone, are metabolised to a significant extent by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, which shows large interindividual variation in activity. Significant relationships between CYP2D6 genotype and steady-state concentrations have been reported for perphenazine, zuclopenthixol, risperidone and haloperidol when used in monotherapy. Other CYPs, especially CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, also contribute to the interindividual variability in the kinetics of antipsychotics and the occurrence of drug interactions. For many antipsychotics, the role of the different CYPs at therapeutic drug concentrations remains to be clarified. Some studies have suggested that poor metabolisers for CYP2D6 would be more prone to oversedation and possibly parkinsonism during treatment with classical antipsychotics, whereas other, mostly retrospective, studies have been negative or inconclusive. For the newer antipsychotics, such data are lacking. Whether phenotyping or genotyping for CYP2D6 or other CYPs can be used to predict an optimal dose range has not been studied so far. Genotyping or phenotyping can today be recommended as a complement to plasma concentration determination when aberrant metabolic capacity (poor or ultrarapid) of CYP2D6 substrates is suspected. The current rapid developments in molecular genetic methodology and pharmacogenetic knowledge can in the near future be expected to provide new tools for prediction of the activity of the various drug-metabolising enzymes.

The cornerstone of clinical management is stabilization and prophylaxis using mood-stabilizing medications to reduce both manic and depressive symptoms. Lithium remains the gold standard of treatment with the strongest data for both efficacy and suicide prevention. However, many patients do not respond to this medication, and clinically there is a great need for tools to aid the clinician in selecting the correct treatment. Large genome wide association studies (GWAS) investigating retrospectively the effect of lithium response are in the pipeline; however, few large prospective studies on genetic predictors to of lithium response have yet been conducted. The purpose of this project is to identify genes that are associated with lithium response in a large prospective cohort of bipolar patients and to better understand the mechanism of action of lithium and the variation in the genome that influences clinical response. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is an 11-site prospective non-randomized open trial of lithium designed to ascertain a cohort of 700 subjects with bipolar I disorder who experience protocol-defined relapse prevention as a result of treatment with lithium monotherapy. All patients will be diagnosed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) and will then enter a 2-year follow-up period on lithium monotherapy if and when they exhibit a score of 1 (normal, not ill), 2 (minimally ill) or 3 (mildly ill) on the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity Scale for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-S-BP Overall Bipolar Illness) for 4 of the 5 preceding weeks. Lithium will be titrated as clinically appropriate, not to exceed serum levels of 1.2 mEq/L. The sample will be evaluated longitudinally using a wide range of clinical scales, cognitive assessments and laboratory tests. On relapse, patients will be discontinued or crossed-over to treatment with valproic acid (VPA) or treatment as usual (TAU). Relapse is defined as a DSM-IV manic, major depressive or mixed episode or if the treating physician decides a change in medication is clinically necessary. The sample will be genotyped for GWAS. The outcome for lithium response will be analyzed as a time to event, where the event is defined as clinical relapse, using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. Positive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from past genetic retrospective studies of lithium response, the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen), will be tested in this prospective study sample; a meta-analysis of these samples will then be performed. Finally, neurons will be derived from pluripotent stem cells from lithium responders and non-responders and tested in vivo for response to lithium by gene expression studies. SNPs in genes identified in these cellular studies will also be tested for association to response. DISCUSSION: Lithium is an extraordinarily important therapeutic drug in the clinical management of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. However, a significant proportion of patients, 30-40 %, fail to respond, and there is currently no method to identify the good lithium responders before initiation of treatment. Converging evidence suggests that genetic factors play a strong role in the variation of response to lithium, but only a few genes have been tested and the samples have largely been retrospective or quite small. The current study will collect an entirely unique sample of 700 patients with bipolar disorder to be stabilized on lithium monotherapy and followed for up to 2 years. This study will produce useful information to improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of lithium and will add to the development of a method to predict individual response to lithium, thereby accelerating recovery and reducing suffering and cost.

Antipsychotic medications are widely prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia however a balancing act is necessary to provide the correct dose to each patient. It is suggested that a large number of patients discontinue antipsychotic pharmacotherapy because the treatments provided do not always reduce the positive symptoms of the disease, while many have adverse effects on the patients. This implies that neither the incorrect drug nor the optimal dosage for that patient is achieved. AREAS COVERED: The current review investigates variability in response to olanzapine with a specific focus on the common intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence both olanzapine and CYP1A2 activity. Furthermore, the authors discuss the utilization of phenotyping and genotyping of CYP1A2 and their potential utility in clinical practice for olanzapine dosing regimens. The authors also consider the potential of pharmacometrics compared to pharmacogenomics as a tool to personalize medicine. EXPERT OPINION: Careful consideration must be given to the impact of a genetic variant on the disposition of a drug prior to implementing genetic 'tests' to determine response. CYP1A2 phenotypic assessment can yield important information regarding the disposition of olanzapine; however, it relies on the accuracy of the metric and the minimal impact of other metabolic pathways. The application of pharmacometrics provides an effective method to establish covariates that significantly influence olanzapine disposition which can incorporate phenotype and/or genotype.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1517/17425255.2013.795540,"Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Benzodiazepines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/*genetics/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Genotype;Humans;Olanzapine;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Schizophrenia;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2",23641727,

Since then, there has been a rapid development of novel ""atypical"" antipsychotic agents that have been pharmacologically modeled, to a certain extent, after their predecessor clozapine. As with all antipsychotics, there is variability among individuals in their response to these ""atypical"" drugs. Pharmacogenetics can provide a foundation for understanding this interindividual variability in antipsychotic response. This review first provides a rationale for the pharmacogenetic investigation of this variable trait. Studies of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors of antipsychotic therapy are considered in the development of this rationale. Next, the molecular genetic techniques used to study this interindividual variation in response are described. This is followed by a review and discussion of the published studies examining genetic factors involved in clozapine response. From this, several recommendations for future pharmacogenetic investigations of antipsychotic response are proposed. Although still in its early stages, psychiatric pharmacogenetics should provide a basis for individualized pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, and may also lead to the development of newer, more efficacious antipsychotic agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/s0006-3223(99)00298-x,"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Clozapine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/genetics;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Humans;Individuality;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Schizophrenia/blood/*drug therapy/genetics;Treatment Outcome;Clozapine;Antipsychotic Agents",10682223,

METHODS: Candidate gene studies that were published in English up to August 6, 2015 were identified by a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Google scholar. Data were pooled from individual clinical trials considering overall symptoms, positive symptoms and negative symptoms, and standard mean differences were calculated by applying a random-effects model. RESULTS: The present meta-analysis included a total of 1281 patients from 10 studies. Three polymorphisms of HTR1A (rs6295, rs878567, and rs1423691) were selected for the analysis. In the pooled data from all studies, none of these HTR1A polymorphisms correlated significantly with either overall symptoms or positive symptoms.

The CYP1A2*1F polymorphism was reported to affect the inducibility of CYP1A2. In our study population, CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype alone resulted in a 22% reduction of dose-/body weight-normalized olanzapine serum concentrations compared to homo- and heterozygote carriers of CYP1A2*1A (both groups without inducers). This effect was independent of the well-known effect of inducing agents (here tobacco smoke and carbamazepine which led to on average 28% lower concentrations in CYP1A2*1A carriers and 26% lower concentrations in CYP1A2*1F/*1F carriers). Consistently, patients with the CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype taking inducers had 22% lower concentrations compared to CYP1A2*1A carriers taking inducers. The influence of genotype alone remained significant after Bonferroni's post hoc test. Higher olanzapine concentrations were significantly correlated with better improvement of paranoid and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenic disorders (Spearman's r=0.5, P=0.026 and P=0.006, respectively). No relationship between serum concentrations and the side effects (DOTES) score was detected. However, patients with the 5-HTR2A intron 2 (rs7997012) AA genotype suffered from more pronounced side effects compared to carriers of the GA or GG genotype (P=0.018 and P=0.002). Short-term weight gain under olanzapine therapy was significantly lower for 5-HTR2C -759 T-allele carriers (P=0.011). Our data suggest that the CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype exhibits a significant influence on olanzapine concentrations independent of other inducing factors. Thus, CYP1A2*1F genotyping may be useful for clinical treatment decisions given the fact that olanzapine serum concentrations correlated with treatment response. Side effects and weight gain, however, seem to be more influenced by serotonergic polymorphisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/tpj.2009.32,"Adult;Aged;Benzodiazepines/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/*genetics;Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy/genetics;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Mianserin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use;Middle Aged;Mirtazapine;Olanzapine;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A/*genetics;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C/genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/genetics;Smoking/blood/genetics;Weight Gain/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2",19636338,

Antipsychotics potentially upregulate gene expression of a lipid metabolism pathway protein called SREBP via SREB transcription factors (SREBFs). Genetic variation within SREBF may contribute to dyslipidemias and lipid medication efficacy within schizophrenia. RESULTS: A cross-sectional study of 157 patients were genotyped for SREBF1 (rs11868035) and SREBF2 (rs1057217) variants, and assessed for fasting lipids. The cohort's mean age was 46.6 years, was 64% male and 86% were using atypical antipsychotics. When stratified by statin use, those receiving a statin and carrying the SREBF1 T allele exhibited higher total cholesterol levels (p = 0.01), triglyceride levels (p = 0.04) and low-density lipoprotein levels (p = 0.03). A regression analysis controlling for gender differences in lipids showed that the SREBF1 T allele and statin interaction remained only for total cholesterol levels (F[4,149] = 5.8; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: For schizophrenia individuals with the SREBF1 rs11868035 T allele, incomplete response to statin medications may be seen.

Multi-gene Pharmacogenomic Testing That Includes Decision-Support Tools to Guide Medication Selection for Major Depression: A Health Technology Assessment.,2021,,,Ontario health technology assessment series,1915-7398 (Electronic),21,13,1-214,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34484487/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Major depression is a substantial public health concern that can affect personal relationships, reduce people's ability to go to school or work, and lead to social isolation. Multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes decision-support tools can help predict which depression medications and dosages are most likely to result in a strong response to treatment or to have the lowest risk of adverse events on the basis of people's genes.We conducted a health technology assessment of multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes decision-support tools for people with major depression. Our assessment evaluated effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized studies (RoBANS) and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria.We performed a systematic literature search of the economic evidence to review published cost-effectiveness studies on multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes a decision-support tool in people with major depression. We developed a state-transition model and conducted a probabilistic analysis to determine the incremental cost of multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing versus treatment as usual per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for people with major depression who had inadequate response to one or more antidepressant medications. In the reference case (with GeneSight-guided care), we considered a 1-year time horizon with an Ontario Ministry of Health perspective. We also estimated the 5-year budget impact of publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing for people with major depression in Ontario.To contextualize the potential value of multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes decision-support tools, we spoke with people who have major depression and their families. RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the clinical evidence review that evaluated six multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests. Although all tests included decision-support tools, they otherwise differed greatly, as did study design, populations included in studies, and outcomes reported. Little or no improvement was observed on change in HAM-D17 depression score compared with treatment as usual for any test evaluated (GRADE: Low-Very Low). GeneSight- and NeuroIDgenetix-guided medication selection led to statistically significant improvements in response (GRADE: Low-Very Low) and remission (GRADE: Low-Very Low), while treatment guided by CNSdose led to significant improvement in remission rates (GRADE: Low), but the study did not report on response. Results were inconsistent and uncertain for the impact of Neuropharmagen, and no significant improvement was observed for Genecept or another unspecified test for either response or remission (GRADE: Low-Very Low). Neuropharmagen may reduce adverse events and CNSDose may reduce intolerability to medication, while no difference was observed in adverse events with GeneSight, Genecept, or another unspecified test (GRADE: Moderate-Very Low). No studies reported data on suicide, treatment adherence, relapse, recovery, or recurrence of depression symptoms.Our review included four model-based economic studies and found that multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing was associated with greater effectiveness and cost savings than treatment as usual, over long-term (i.e., 3-,5-year and lifetime) time horizons. Since none of the included studies was fully applicable to the Ontario health care system, we conducted a primary economic evaluation.Our reference case analysis over the 1-year time horizon found that multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing (with GeneSight) was associated with additional QALYs (0.03, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.005; 0.072) and additional costs ($1,906, 95% Crl: $688; $3,360). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $60,564 per QALY gained. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective (vs. treatment as usual) was 36.8% at a willingness-to-pay amount of $50,000 per QALY (i.e., moderately likely not to be cost-effective), rising to 70.7% at a willingness-to-pay amount of $100,000 per QALY (i.e., moderately likely to be cost-effective). Evidence informing economic modeling of the reference case with GeneSight and other multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests was of low to very low quality, implying considerable uncertainty or low confidence in the effectiveness estimates. The price of the test, efficacy of the intervention on remission, time horizon, and analytic perspective were major determinants of the cost-effectiveness results. If the test price were assumed to be $2,162 (compared with $2,500 in the reference case), the intervention would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay amount of $50,000 per QALY; moreover, if the price decreased to $595, the intervention would be cost saving (or dominant) compared with treatment as usual.At an increasing uptake of 1% per year and a test price of $2,500, the annual budget impact of publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing in Ontario over the next 5 years ranged from an additional $3.5 million in year 1 (at uptake of 1%) to $16.8 million in year 5. The 5-year budget impact was estimated at about $52 million.People with major depression and caregivers generally supported multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing because they believed it could provide guidance that fit their values. They hoped such guidance would speed symptom relief, would reduce side effects and help inform their medication choices. Some patients expressed concerns over maintaining confidentiality of test results and the possibility that physicians would sacrifice patient-centred care to follow pharmacogenomic guidance. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes decision-support tools to guide medication selection for depression varies widely. Differences between individual tests must be considered, as clinical utility observed with one test might not apply to other tests. Overall, effectiveness was inconsistent among the six multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests we identified. Multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests may result in little or no difference in improvement in depression scores compared with treatment as usual, but some tests may improve response to treatment or remission from depression. The impact on adverse events is uncertain. The evidence, however, is uncertain, and therefore our confidence that these observed effects reflect the true effects is low to very low.For the management of major depression in people who had inadequate response to at least one medication, some multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests that include decision support tools are associated with additional costs and QALYs over the 1-year time horizon, and maybe be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay amount of $100,000 per QALY. Publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing in Ontario would result in additional annual costs of between $3.5 million and $16.8 million, with a total budget impact of about $52 million over the next 5 years.People with major depression and caregivers generally supported multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing because they believed it could provide guidance that fit their values.

METHODS: 200 TRS patients were enrolled in the study during their follow up visit post clozapine initiation. SNP assessment was performed for DRD3 (rs6280) and ABCB1(rs1045462) by sequencing. Blood sample for genotyping was collected with disease and treatment related variables recording on case record form. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders based upon Andreasen criteria and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). RESULTS: Mean clozapine dose, the genotype frequency distribution of ABCB1, DRD3 SNPs were significantly different in clozapine responder and non-responder study population (p < 0.05). CT genotype of ABCB1 and AG genotype of DRD3 were observed to be more prevalent in the responder group. TT genotype of ABCB1 and AG genotype of DRD3 were prevalent in the nonresponder group. Clozapine dosing equations for responder and nonresponder TRS populations were developed through logistic regression analysis. 27% variability in clozapine dose was explained by possible combinations of ABCB1 and DRD3 SNP analysis. CONCLUSION: Differential ABCB1(rs1045462) and DRD3(rs6280) genotype frequencies among the clozapine responders and non-responders explained clear feasibility of response predictor potential along with clozapine dose variability association. Pharmacogenetically guided clozapine dosing is possible if more SNPs are considered together with ABCB1(rs1045462) and DRD3(rs6280) in TRS patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ajp.2019.101918,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics;Adult;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage;Biomarkers;Clozapine/*administration & dosage;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Humans;India/ethnology;Male;Middle Aged;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Prognosis;Receptors, Dopamine D3/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/ethnology/physiopathology;Young Adult;Schizophrenia;Polymorphism, Genetic;Pharmacogenetics;Clozapine",31896438,

These findings led us to determine whether variation in the CHRM4 gene sequence was associated with an altered risk of schizophrenia by sequencing the CHRM4 gene from the brains of 76 people with the disorder and 74 people with no history of psychiatric disorders. In addition, because the CHRM4 is a potential target for antipsychotic drug development, we investigated whether variations in CHRM4 sequence were associated with final recorded doses of, and life-time exposure to, antipsychotic drugs. Gene sequencing identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2067482 and rs72910092) in the CHRM4 gene. For rs2067482, our data suggested that both genotype (1341C/C; p = 0.05) and allele (C; p = 0.03) were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. In addition, there was a strong trend (p = 0.08) towards an association between CHRM4 sequence and increased lifetime exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, there was a trend for people with the C allele to be prescribed benzodiazepines more frequently (p = 0.06) than those with the T allele. These data, albeit on small cohorts, are consistent with genetic variance at rs2067482 contributing to an altered risk of developing schizophrenia which requires more forceful pharmacotherapy to achieve a clinical response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.schres.2013.01.023,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Association Studies;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Receptor, Muscarinic M4/*genetics;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics;Statistics, Nonparametric;Polymorphism, Genetic",23490763,

The fact that they are more common, diverse and perceived as embedded in normal life may explain this relative oversight. In addition, as for other psychiatric disorders, there are technical challenges related to the identification and validation of candidate genes and peripheral biomarkers. Human studies, particularly genetic ones, are susceptible to the issue of being underpowered, because of genetic heterogeneity, the effect of variable environmental exposure on gene expression, and difficulty of accrual of large, well phenotyped cohorts. Animal model gene expression studies, in a genetically homogeneous and experimentally tractable setting, can avoid artifacts and provide sensitivity of detection. Subsequent translational integration of the animal model datasets with human genetic and gene expression datasets can ensure cross-validatory power and specificity for illness. We have used a pharmacogenomic mouse model (involving treatments with an anxiogenic drug--yohimbine, and an anti-anxiety drug--diazepam) as a discovery engine for identification of anxiety candidate genes as well as potential blood biomarkers. Gene expression changes in key brain regions for anxiety (prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus) and blood were analyzed using a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach, which integrates our new data with published human and animal model data, as a translational strategy of cross-matching and prioritizing findings. Our work identifies top candidate genes (such as FOS, GABBR1, NR4A2, DRD1, ADORA2A, QKI, RGS2, PTGDS, HSPA1B, DYNLL2, CCKBR and DBP), brain-blood biomarkers (such as FOS, QKI and HSPA1B), pathways (such as cAMP signaling) and mechanisms for anxiety disorders--notably signal transduction and reactivity to environment, with a prominent role for the hippocampus. Overall, this work complements our previous similar work (on bipolar mood disorders and schizophrenia) conducted over the last decade. It concludes our programmatic first pass mapping of the genomic landscape of the triad of major psychiatric disorder domains using CFG, and permitted us to uncover the significant genetic overlap between anxiety and these other major psychiatric disorders, notably the under-appreciated overlap with schizophrenia. PDE10A, TAC1 and other genes uncovered by our work provide a molecular basis for the frequently observed clinical co-morbidity and interdependence between anxiety and other major psychiatric disorders, and suggest schizo-anxiety as a possible new nosological domain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1038/tp.2011.9,"Animals;Anxiety Disorders/*genetics/psychology;Biomarkers/metabolism;Cyclic AMP/genetics;Disease Models, Animal;*Genes;Genomics/methods;Humans;Mice;Models, Animal;Schizophrenia/genetics;Signal Transduction/*genetics;Translational Research, Biomedical/methods;Anxiety Disorders;Genome;Genomics",22832404,PMC3309477

A network model of the interaction/crosstalk between the neurotransmitter signaling systems is presented to emphasize the importance of the genes associated with the molecular mechanisms of the disease and drug response. These genes may serve as potential susceptibility genes and drug targets for schizophrenia.

Thorough assessments of diet, lifestyle, and endothelial functioning have not been done in this population. Omega 3 Fatty Acids (N-3 FAs) have garnered attention in relation to psychopathology as well as cardioprotection. This study examined the status of endothelial function within the schizophrenia population and determined pharmacogenetic, medication, dietary, and lifestyle factors associated with this functioning. METHODS: Schizophrenia subjects were screened for the metabolic syndrome along with physical activity, smoking, and variants related to folate pharmacogenetics in this cross-sectional analysis. Arteriole endothelial-dependent vasodilatation was measured using non-invasive peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT, EndoPAT2000). A 24h dietary food recall was used to construct intake profiles using the Nutrition Data Systems for Research software (NDSR). We examined associations between AAP use and RH-PAT values, and the influence of N-3 FA dietary intake on this measure. Preliminary data are reported in 83 subjects with a mean age (±s.d.) of 45.89 (±11.49), 64% were Caucasian (n=53), 64% were male (n=53), and 77% were receiving AAP treatment (n=63). RESULTS: A significant positive relationship was found between RH-PAT values and N-3 FA intake (F=17.7(1,16), p=0.0007) in subjects not receiving AAPs. This relationship was lost in those treated with AAPs (F=0.25(1,43), p>0.6). Regression analysis confirmed the interaction effect of AAP treatment on the relationship between RH-PAT and N-3 FAs (p=0.0105). Endothelial dysfunction was also related to folate pharmacogenetic variants. CONCLUSIONS: AAPs may counteract some vascular health benefits of a diet high in N-3 FAs. AAP use may necessitate a higher N-3 FA dose to regain these effects, but additional research is necessary to strengthen the preliminary findings. Pharmacogenetic variants related to folate and homocysteine metabolism may also increase endothelial dysfunction risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.schres.2011.03.031,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Arterioles/*drug effects/metabolism;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Endothelium-Dependent Relaxing Factors/*metabolism;Fatty Acids, Omega-3/administration & dosage;Female;Folic Acid/metabolism;Homocysteine/metabolism;Humans;*Life Style;Male;Manometry/methods;Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics;Middle Aged;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Regression Analysis;*Schizophrenia/complications/drug therapy/genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Young Adult;Life Style;Arterioles;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics",21504842,PMC3139795

Promising candidates include a possible impact of antipsychotics on peptide hormonal regulators of metabolic control such as leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent data on changes in these hormones during atypical antipsychotic treatment. METHODS: A Medline search was performed for papers published from January 1999 to January 2007 using key words antipsychotic, atypical antipsychotic, and individual atypical antipsychotic drug names cross-referenced with leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin. RESULTS: The bulk of the published work focused on changes in body weight and serum leptin, with far less data on ghrelin, and adiponectin, and nonweight metabolic changes. Leptin changes were directly related to a medication's weight gain liability, with no added antipsychotic effects on leptin signaling. Conflicting results emerged for the other markers, but all three long-term studies on ghrelin showed increased levels in patients on atypical antipsychotics with weight gain liabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Leptin increases during antipsychotic treatment are a result of weight gain rather than a direct impact of atypical antipsychotics on leptin physiology. Preliminary long-term data show increased ghrelin levels, but this finding must be replicated. The association with antipsychotic effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and these hormones remains virtually unstudied. Future research should indicate whether ghrelin and other peptide hormones may be useful predictors of weight gain or metabolic changes in patients on antipsychotics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.schres.2007.11.026,Adiponectin/*blood;Adult;Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use;Body Mass Index;Body Weight/drug effects/genetics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Ghrelin/*blood;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Leptin/*blood/genetics;Male;Metabolic Syndrome/blood/*chemically induced;Obesity/blood/*chemically induced;Pharmacogenetics;Prospective Studies;Rats;Schizophrenia/*blood/drug therapy;Antipsychotic Agents;Leptin;Adiponectin,18206351,PMC2699769
Genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes with pharmacologic intervention in African-American patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.,2009,10,,Schizophrenia research,1573-2509 (Electronic),114,1,50-6,Irvin MR and Wiener HW and Perry RP and Savage RM and Go RC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19643578/,eng,,,"An increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients has been observed. Exposure to antipsychotics (APs) has been shown to induce metabolic dysregulation in some patients but not all treated patients. We hypothesized that important candidate genes for T2D may increase risk for T2D in African-American patients with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. The PAARTNERS study comprises African-American families with at least one proband with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. The current study of PAARTNERS SCZ and schizoaffective disorder cases (N=820) examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within select T2D candidate genes including transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), calpain 10 (CAPN10), and ectoenzyme nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENNP1) for association with prevalent T2D. We report the association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) with T2D under both additive and recessive models for the risk allele T. Specifically, the odds ratio (OR) for having T2D was 1.4 (p=0.03) under an additive model and 2.4 (p=0.004) under a recessive model. We also report a marginally significant TCF7L2 by AP treatment interaction that should be investigated in future studies. CAPN10 (rs3792267) was marginally associated with T2D with OR=1.5 (p=0.08) when considering the model GG vs. AG/AA with risk allele G. ENPP1 (rs1044498) was not associated with T2D. We conclude TCF7L2, a risk factor for T2D in the general population, is also a risk factor for T2D in African-American patients with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. Research is needed to determine if T2D associated polymorphisms are of interest in the pharmacogenetics and future treatment choices of antipsychotics in African-American patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.schres.2009.07.008,"Adult;African Americans/*genetics;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Calpain/genetics;*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/chemically induced/genetics;Family Health;Female;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetics, Population;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Odds Ratio;Pharmacogenetics;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/genetics;Pyrophosphatases/genetics;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/genetics;TCF Transcription Factors/genetics;Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein;Schizophrenia;Psychotic Disorders",19643578,PMC2753171

It is thought that the insulin resistance resulting from the use of AAPs may be associated with changes in DNA methylation. We aimed to identify and validate a candidate gene associated with AAP-induced insulin resistance by using a multi-step approach that included an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and validation with site-specific methylation and metabolomics data. METHODS: Subjects with bipolar disorder treated with AAPs or lithium monotherapy were recruited for a cross-sectional visit to analyze peripheral blood DNA methylation and insulin resistance. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed in a discovery sample (n = 48) using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Validation analyses of the epigenome-wide findings occurred in a separate sample (n = 72) using site-specific methylation with pyrosequencing and untargeted metabolomics data. Regression analyses were conducted controlling for known confounders in all analyses and a mediation analysis was performed to investigate if AAP-induced insulin resistance occurs through changes in DNA methylation. RESULTS: A differentially methylated probe associated with insulin resistance was discovered and validated in the fatty acyl CoA reductase 2 (FAR2) gene of chromosome 12. Functional associations of this DNA methylation site with untargeted phospholipid-related metabolites were also detected. Our results identified a mediating effect of this FAR2 methylation site on AAP-induced insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Going forward, prospective, longitudinal studies assessing comprehensive changes in FAR2 DNA methylation, expression, and lipid metabolism before and after AAP treatment are required to assess its potential role in the development of insulin resistance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1111/bdi.12422,"Adult;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/*genetics;*Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy;DNA Methylation/*drug effects;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Insulin Resistance/*physiology;Male;Pharmacogenetics;Prospective Studies;Reproducibility of Results;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Insulin Resistance;Methylation",27542345,PMC5322870

Common genetic variation and antidepressant efficacy in major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of three genome-wide pharmacogenetic studies.,2013,2,,The American journal of psychiatry,1535-7228 (Electronic),170,2,207-17,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23377640/,eng,,United States,"OBJECTIVE: Indirect evidence suggests that common genetic variation contributes to individual differences in antidepressant efficacy among individuals with major depressive disorder, but previous studies may have been underpowered to detect these effects. METHOD: A meta-analysis was performed on data from three genome-wide pharmacogenetic studies (the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression [GENDEP] project, the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature [MARS] project, and the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression [STAR*D] study), which included 2,256 individuals of Northern European descent with major depressive disorder, and antidepressant treatment outcomes were prospectively collected. After imputation, 1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested, capturing common variation for association with symptomatic improvement and remission after up to 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. RESULTS: No individual association met a genome-wide threshold for statistical significance in the primary analyses. A polygenic score derived from a meta-analysis of GENDEP and MARS participants accounted for up to approximately 1.2% of the variance in outcomes in STAR*D, suggesting a weakly concordant signal distributed over many polymorphisms. An analysis restricted to 1,354 individuals treated with citalopram (STAR*D) or escitalopram (GENDEP) identified an intergenic region on chromosome 5 associated with early improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased statistical power accorded by meta-analysis, the authors identified no reliable predictors of antidepressant treatment outcome, although they did identify modest, direct evidence that common genetic variation contributes to individual differences in antidepressant response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12020237,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5;*Citalopram/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics;Europe/epidemiology;Female;Genetic Variation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Remission Induction;Treatment Outcome;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Antidepressive Agents;Genome;Genomics",23377640,

Therapeutic plasma concentrations of risperidone and its active moiety are directly influenced by genetic variations in metabolic CYP450 enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5) and transporter (ABCB1) protein and additional environmental factors. Since active metabolite 9-OH risperidone has a greater percentage of the pharmacologically active fraction and is equipotent to the parent drug risperidone, it is assumed that it contributes significantly to therapeutic and adverse effects. Unpredictable dose/concentration ratio, narrow therapeutic index, number of interactions, along with serious adverse reactions (ADR), raises the need for individualization of risperidone treatment and establishing of good therapeutic regime using TDM. A simple and reliable validated bioanalytical liquide-liquide extraction HPLC/UV method was applied for the simultaneous determination of risperidone and its active metabolite, 9-OH risperidone, in human plasma and urine of 52 hospitalized schizophrenia/bipolar disorder patients treated with risperidone as monotherapy and in polytherapy.

Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), one of the major modulators of prefrontal dopamine function, has emerged as an important determinant of schizophrenia associated cognitive dysfunction and response to antipsychotics. A common Val->Met polymorphism (rs4680) in the COMT gene, associated with increased prefrontal dopamine catabolism, impairs prefrontal cognition and might increase risk for schizophrenia. Further, the degree of cognitive improvement observed with antipsychotics in schizophrenia patients is influenced by the COMT activity, and Val/Met has been proposed as a potential pharmacogenetic marker. However, studies evaluating the role of COMT have been equivocal. The presence of other functional polymorphisms in the gene, and the observed ethnic variations in the linkage disequilibrium structure at COMT locus, suggest that COMT activity regulation might be complex. Despite these lacunae in our current understanding, the influence of COMT on PFC mediated cognitive tasks is undeniable. COMT thus represents an attractive candidate for novel therapeutic interventions for cognitive dysfunction. The COMT activity inhibiting drugs including tolcapone and entacapone, have shown promising potential as they selectively modulate dopaminergic transmission.

This article reviews some neurochemical, psychoimmunological, pharmacogenetic and neuromorphological patterns which can affect drug response and determine drug-resistance phenomena in schizophrenia. Several neurochemical abnormalities have been reported to be relevant for the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders and have been related to clinical symptoms as well as to the quality of response to antipsychotics: most of the findings come from studies on DA and 5HT brain metabolism, but more recently other non-dopaminergic pathways have been implicated (e.g., glutamatergic ones). Literature data suggest that schizophrenia may be associated with significant alterations of T-cell functions, showing the activation of the inflammatory response system (IRS), particularly in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and differential effects on IRS have been reported for conventional and atypical antipsychotics. Furthermore molecular genetic approaches provide a novel method of dissecting the heterogeneity of psychotropic drug response, providing the means of determining the molecular substrates of drug efficacy and drug-induced adverse events. On the other hand, functional neuroimaging techniques, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), providing an in vivo assessment of the expression and function of neuroreceptors, transporters and enzymes, seem to be particularly promising for a better understanding of 'real' drug resistance.

Abnormalities in both of these mechanisms are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP). In addition, several lines of evidence support an association between abnormalities in neuronal nitric oxide synthases (nNOS) and mood disorders. Therefore, we studied the association of nNOS gene (NOS1) and mood disorders and the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment in Japanese MDD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs41279104, also called ex1c), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (325 MDD patients, 154 BP patients and 807 controls) in the Japanese population. In addition, we performed an association analysis between NOS1 and the efficacy of fluvoxamine treatment in 117 MDD patients. We defined a clinical response as a decrease of more than 50% in baseline SIGH-D (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) score within 8 weeks, and clinical remission as an SIGH-D score of less than 7 at 8 weeks. RESULTS: We did not detect a significant association between NOS1 and MDD, BP or the fluvoxamine therapeutic response in MDD in allele/genotype-wise analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect an association between only one marker (rs41279104) in NOS1 and Japanese mood disorder patients and fluvoxamine response, but sample sizes were probably too small to allow a meaningful test. Moreover, because we did not perform an association analysis based on linkage disequilibrium and a mutation scan of NOS1, a replication of the study using a larger sample and based on linkage disequilibrium may be required for conclusive results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1159/000265130,"Adult;Aged;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use;Chi-Square Distribution;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Fluvoxamine/*therapeutic use;Gene Frequency;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Genotype;Humans;Japan/ethnology;Male;Middle Aged;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I/*genetics;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Nitric Oxide Synthase;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major",20016223,

Identifying blood biomarkers for mood disorders using convergent functional genomics.,2009,2,,Molecular psychiatry,1476-5578 (Electronic),14,2,156-74,Le-Niculescu H and Kurian SM and Yehyawi N and Dike C and Patel SD and Edenberg HJ and Tsuang MT and Salomon DR and Nurnberger JI Jr and Niculescu AB,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18301394/,eng,,England,"There are to date no objective clinical laboratory blood tests for mood disorders. The current reliance on patient self-report of symptom severity and on the clinicians' impression is a rate-limiting step in effective treatment and new drug development. We propose, and provide proof of principle for, an approach to help identify blood biomarkers for mood state. We measured whole-genome gene expression differences in blood samples from subjects with bipolar disorder that had low mood vs those that had high mood at the time of the blood draw, and separately, changes in gene expression in brain and blood of a mouse pharmacogenomic model. We then integrated our human blood gene expression data with animal model gene expression data, human genetic linkage/association data and human postmortem brain data, an approach called convergent functional genomics, as a Bayesian strategy for cross-validating and prioritizing findings. Topping our list of candidate blood biomarker genes we have five genes involved in myelination (Mbp, Edg2, Mag, Pmp22 and Ugt8), and six genes involved in growth factor signaling (Fgfr1, Fzd3, Erbb3, Igfbp4, Igfbp6 and Ptprm). All of these genes have prior evidence of differential expression in human postmortem brains from mood disorder subjects. A predictive score developed based on a panel of 10 top candidate biomarkers (five for high mood and five for low mood) shows sensitivity and specificity for high mood and low mood states, in two independent cohorts. Our studies suggest that blood biomarkers may offer an unexpectedly informative window into brain functioning and disease state.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/mp.2008.11,Adult;Aged;Animals;Bayes Theorem;Biomarkers/*blood;Brain/metabolism;Case-Control Studies;Cohort Studies;Female;Gene Expression/physiology;Gene Expression Profiling/methods;Genomics/*methods;Humans;Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/blood/genetics;Male;Mice;Middle Aged;Mood Disorders/*blood/classification/*genetics/pathology;Myelin Sheath/genetics/metabolism;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods;Postmortem Changes;Predictive Value of Tests;Reference Values;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Transduction/genetics;Young Adult;Biological Markers;Mood Disorders;Genomics;Genome,18301394,
The impact of catechol-O-methyltransferase SNPs and haplotypes on treatment response phenotypes in major depressive disorder: a case-control association study.,2010,7,,International clinical psychopharmacology,1473-5857 (Electronic),25,4,218-27,Kocabas NA and Faghel C and Barreto M and Kasper S and Linotte S and Mendlewicz J and Noro M and Oswald P and Souery D and Zohar J and Massat I,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20531207/,eng,,England,"Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis and pharmacological treatment of affective disorders. The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4 (Val108/158Met; rs4680) influences the COMT enzyme activity. Inconsistent results were found between Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) and treatment response phenotypes in genetic association studies. However, the haplotype combinations of alleles at the Val108/158Met SNP with the other synonymous SNPs in the COMT gene region have shown association between enzyme activity/amount and COMT-dependent phenotypes. We carried out this study to define the functional impact of COMT genotypes/haplotypes on susceptibility and on treatment response phenotypes of major depressive disorder (MDD). Three hundred and ninety-six patients with MDD diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [(DSM)-IV] and 295 healthy controls were recruited for this study and genotyped for the seven COMT SNPs (rs2075507, rs737865, rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, rs4680, and rs165599). This is the first study with all these SNPs to investigate for MDD and treatment response phenotypes. Our results show that none of the seven SNPs, including the rs4680, was significantly associated with MDD after permutation correction in single SNP analyses. Although several haplotype combinations showed significance, the combinations of G-T-G-G haplotype for rs6269, rs4633, rs4818 and rs4680 were only present in the MDD group (G-T 4.5%, corrected sim P=0.0001; G-T-G 3.87%, corrected sim P=0.001; G-T-G-G 3.3% corrected sim P=0.0025). In the treatment response phenotypes, the GG genotype of the rs2075507 SNP (located in the promoter region of MB-COMT) was less common in resistant patients in a single SNP analysis with low corrected sim P=0.052 and power=0.086. However, in the haplotype analysis, the haplotypes of exonic SNPs, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680, were related to the treatment response phenotypes investigated, especially the phenotype of the response to antidepressant treatment. The C-C-A haplotype of these SNPs was overrepresented (almost four-and eight-fold) in the responders compared with the nonresponders and controls, respectively, after Bonferroni correction (corrected sim P=0.048, 0.0001, respectively). Both nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs within haplotypes may be more relevant than the single SNP in conferring MDD susceptibility and treatment response phenotypes. Despite the limited power of our analysis, this finding suggests that the polymorphic COMT gene that influences catecholaminergic neurotransmission may play a role in the individual response to antidepressants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/YIC.0b013e328338b884,"Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics;Drug Resistance/genetics;Female;Gene Frequency/genetics;Genetic Association Studies;Genotype;Haplotypes/*genetics;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Remission Induction;Treatment Outcome;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder;Catechols;Methyltransferases;Haplotypes",20531207,

Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice. AIMS: We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research. METHODS: We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session. RESULTS: We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1136/gpsych-2021-100685,Biological Markers;Schizophrenia,35309241,PMC8867318
Effect of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on serum valproic level acid in Chinese Han patients with schizophrenia.,2021,11,30,Scientific reports,2045-2322 (Electronic),11,1,23150,Wang S and Li J and Song M and Yan P and Ju X and Liu J and Wang C and Shi J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34848811/,eng,,,"Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant, which is also widely used for treating psychiatric disorders. Some clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of valproic acid augmentation therapy in schizophrenia. Interindividual variability in valproic acid dose and serum concentration may reflect functional consequences of genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between serum concentrations of valproic acid and single nucleotide polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 gene in patients with schizophrenia. All patients had been receiving fixed dose of valproic acid for at least 2 weeks. The daily doses were 0.5-1.5 g. No other drugs except olanzapine were coadministered. Serum concentrations of valproic acid were measured using the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method with mass-spectrometric detection. The CYP2C19 (CYP2C19*2 G681A rs4244285 and CYP2C19*3 G636A rs4986893) genotypes were identified by real-time PCR analyses. The mean concentration/dose ratios of valproic acid were significantly higher in patients with CYP2C19 *1/*2 genotype (P < 0.01) or CYP2C19 *2/*3 genotype (P < 0.01) than in those with CYP2C12 *1/*1 genotype. The mean concentration/dose ratios of valproic acid were significantly higher in patients with 1 (P < 0.01) or 2 (P < 0.01) mutated alleles for CYP2C19 than in those without mutated alleles. And the post hoc analysis revealed that the result has acceptable statistical (power (1 - β) = 0.8486 at type I  level of 0.05) to support the observed significant associations for CYP2C19 SNPs and serum C/D ratios of valproic acid. The findings of this study suggest that the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 significantly affect the steady-state serum concentrations of valproic acid in Chinese Han population. The determination of the CYP2C19 genotypes may be useful for dosing adjustment in schizophrenia patients on valproic acid therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41598-021-02628-x,"Adult;Alleles;Anticonvulsants/blood;Asians;China;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/*genetics;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Middle Aged;Olanzapine/administration & dosage;Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction;Regression Analysis;Schizophrenia/*blood/*drug therapy/ethnology/*genetics;Valproic Acid/*blood;Young Adult;Schizophrenia;Polymorphism, Genetic",34848811,PMC8632882
Should pharmacogenetics be incorporated in major depression treatment?

The aim of this study is to quantify the cost-utility of incorporating 5-HTTLPR genotyping in drug treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We previously reported a theoretical model to simulate antidepressant treatment with citalopram or bupropion for 12 weeks. The drugs were alternatively selected according to an 'as usual' algorithm or based on response and tolerability predicted by 5-HTTLPR profile. Here we apply this model to conduct a cost-utility analysis in three European regions with high GDP (Euro A), middle GDP (Euro B) and middle-high GDP (Euro C). In addition we test a verification scenario in which citalopram+bupropion augmentation is administered to individuals with the least favorable 5-HTTLPR genotype. Treatment outcomes are remission and Quality Adjusted-Life Weeks (QALW). Cost data (international $, year 2009) are retrieved from the World Health Organization (WHO) and national official sources. In base-case scenario incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values are $1147 (Euro A), $1185 (Euro B) and $1178 (Euro C). From cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), the probability of having an ICER value below WHO recommended cost-utility threshold (3 GDP per capita=$1926) is >90% in high-income countries (Euro A). In middle- income regions, these probabilities are <30% (Euro B) and <55% (Euro C) respectively. All estimates are robust against variations in treatment parameters, but if genetic test cost decreases to $100, pharmacogenetic approach becomes cost-effective in middle-income countries (Euro B). This simulation using data from 27 European states suggests that choosing antidepressant treatment from the results of 5-HTTLPR might be a cost-effective solution in high income countries.

Clinical heterogeneity of schizophrenia contributes to the poor replication of the findings of pharmacogenetic association studies. Functionally important HTR3A gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were reported to be associated with response to clozapine. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how the association between HTR3A gene SNP and response to clozapine is influenced by various clinical predictors and by differing outcome definitions in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). METHODS: We recruited 101 consecutive patients with TRS, on stable doses of clozapine, and evaluated their HTR3A gene SNP (rs1062613 and rs2276302), psychopathology, and serum clozapine levels. We assessed their socio-demographic and clinical profiles, premorbid adjustment, traumatic events, cognition, and disability using standard assessment schedules. We evaluated their response to clozapine, by employing six differing outcome definitions. We employed appropriate multivariate statistics to calculate allelic and genotypic association, accounting for the effects of various clinical variables. RESULTS: T allele of rs1062613 and G allele of rs2276302 were significantly associated with good clinical response to clozapine (p = 0.02). However, varying outcome definitions make these associations inconsistent. rs1062613 and rs2276302 could explain only 13.8 % variability in the responses to clozapine, while combined clinical predictors and HTR3A pharmacogenetic association model could explain 38 % variability. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the results of pharmacogenetic studies in schizophrenia depend heavily on their outcome definitions and that combined clinical and pharmacogenetic models have better predictive values. Future pharmacogenetic studies should employ multiple outcome definitions and should evaluate associated clinical variables.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00213-012-2773-2,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Chi-Square Distribution;Clozapine/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Cross-Sectional Studies;Drug Resistance/genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Genotype;Humans;Logistic Models;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Odds Ratio;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3/*drug effects/*genetics;Schizophrenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Serotonin Antagonists/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Schizophrenia",22700043,

This pivotal study changed the face of pharmacogenetics research by increasing the sample size by an order of magnitude as well as by providing detailed prospective information about antidepressant response and tolerability. Several groups have identified markers in genes and tested the replication of previous findings of genes associated with outcome and side effects of antidepressant treatment. Variants in HTR2A, GRIK4, and KCNK2 were associated with citalopram treatment outcome. Replication was achieved in markers in the FKBP5 gene. Other findings in PDE11A and BDNF were not successfully replicated, and reports of potential confounders in previous associations with serotonin transporter variation (SLC6A4) were identified. Polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic genes involved in metabolism and transmembrane transport were also not associated with antidepressant response. Adverse events were also tested. Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was associated with GRIK2, GRIA3, PAPLN, IL28RA, and CREB1. Sexual dysfunction was linked with variation in GRIN3A, GRIA1 GRIA3, and GRIK2.

Therefore, we investigated the role of rare functional variants in antidepressant response. METHOD: Mexican-American individuals meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) participated in a prospective randomized, double-blind study with desipramine or fluoxetine. The rare variant analysis was performed using whole-exome genotyping data. Network and pathway analyses were carried out with the list of significant genes. RESULTS: The Kernel-Based Adaptive Cluster method identified functional rare variants in 35 genes significantly associated with treatment remission (False discovery rate, FDR <0.01). Pathway analysis of these genes supports the involvement of the following gene ontology processes: olfactory/sensory transduction, regulation of response to cytokine stimulus, and meiotic cell cycleprocess.

There is still, however, a lack of clarity surrounding the clinical features and response periods across samples that respond to ketamine. This paper systematically reviews published randomized controlled trials that investigate ketamine as an antidepressant intervention in both unipolar and bipolar depression to determine the specific clinical features of the samples across different efficacy periods. Moreover, similarities and differences in clinical characteristics associated with acute versus longer-term drug response are discussed. Similarities across all samples suggest that the population that responds to ketamine's antidepressant effect has experienced chronic, long-term depression, approaching ketamine treatment as a ""last resort"". Moreover, differences between these groups suggest future research to investigate the potential of stronger efficacy towards depression in the context of bipolar disorder compared to major depression, and in participants who undergo antidepressant washout before ketamine administration. From these findings, suggestions for the future direction of ketamine research for depression are formed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2174/1568026620666200423094423,Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Depression/*drug therapy;Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy;Humans;Ketamine/*therapeutic use;Ketamine,32324515,
Comparing sensitivity to change using the 6-item versus the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale in the GUIDED randomized controlled trial.,2019,12,27,BMC psychiatry,1471-244X (Electronic),19,1,420,Dunlop BW and Parikh SV and Rothschild AJ and Thase ME and DeBattista C and Conway CR and Forester BP and Mondimore FM and Shelton RC and Macaluso M and Logan J and Traxler P and Li J and Johnson H and Greden JF,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31881956/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) is less sensitive in detecting differences between active treatment and placebo for major depressive disorder (MDD) than is the HAM-D6 scale, which focuses on six core depression symptoms. Whether HAM-D6 shows greater sensitivity when comparing two active MDD treatment arms is unknown. METHODS: This post hoc analysis used data from the intent-to-treat (ITT) cohort (N = 1541) of the Genomics Used to Improve DEpression Decisions (GUIDED) trial, a rater- and patient-blinded randomized controlled trial. GUIDED compared combinatorial pharmacogenomics-guided care with treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with MDD. Percent of symptom improvement, response rate and remission rate from baseline to week 8 were evaluated using both scales. Analyses were performed for the full cohort and for the subset of patients who at baseline were taking medications predicted by the test to have moderate or significant gene-drug interactions. A Mokken scale analysis was conducted to compare the homogeneity of HAM-D17 with that of HAM-D6. RESULTS: At week 8, the guided-care arm demonstrated statistically significant benefit over TAU when the HAM-D6 (∆ = 4.4%, p = 0.023) was used as the continuous measure of symptom improvement, but not when using the HAM-D17 (∆ = 3.2%, p = 0.069). Response rates increased significantly for guided-care compared with TAU when evaluated using both HAM-D6 (∆ = 7.0%, p = 0.004) and HAM-D17 (∆ = 6.3%, p = 0.007). Remission rates also were significantly greater for guided-care versus TAU using both measures (HAM-D6 ∆ = 4.6%, p = 0.031; HAM-D17 ∆ = 5.5%, p = 0.005). Patients in the guided-care arm who at baseline were taking medications predicted to have gene-drug interactions showed further increased benefit over TAU at week 8 for symptom improvement (∆ = 7.3%, p = 0.004) response (∆ = 10.0%, p = 0.001) and remission (∆ = 7.9%, p = 0.005) using HAM-D6. All outcomes showed continued improvement through week 24. Mokken scale analysis demonstrated the homogeneity and unidimensionality of HAM-D6, but not of HAM-D17, across treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The HAM-D6 scale identified a statistically significant difference in symptom improvement between combinatorial pharmacogenomics-guided care and TAU, whereas the HAM-D17 did not. The demonstrated utility of pharmacogenomics-guided treatment over TAU as detected by the HAM-D6 highlights its value for future biomarker-guided trials comparing active treatment arms.

Pharmacogenetic studies have focused on polymorphisms in liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that metabolize many antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. The most significant results are the association between drug metabolic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 with variations in drug metabolic rates and side effects. Additionally, polymorphisms in dopamine and serotonin receptor genes are repeatedly found associated with response phenotypes, probably reflecting the strong affinities that most antipsychotics display for these receptors. The contribution of kinetic factors to the clinical outcome of antipsychotic treatment has a strong evidence base. Genetic tests for the pretreatment prediction of antipsychotic response have obvious implications for the selection of most appropriate drug and dose and contribute for the optimization of antipsychotic treatment. The pretreatment determination of individual's drug metabolic rates by CYP genotyping is the leading field.

Many drugs indicated for the treatment of CNS disorders are fraught with side effects and/or poor efficacy which impact patients' quality of life and drives non-compliance. Moreover, for many CNS drugs such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, it takes time to determine whether a particular drug is efficacious in an individual patient. To optimize drug treatment for each patient, prescribing physicians often need to raise or lower doses, switch drug classes, or prescribe additional drugs to mitigate side effects, often in a ""trial and error"" fashion. Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing, particularly in the realm of CNS therapy, can reduce the unpredictability of this process. By determining a patient's genetic profile, individual therapy parameters may be predicted pre-treatment for drug efficacy, optimal drug dose, and the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The intent of this review is to highlight the power of PGx testing to predict the likelihood of ADRs and efficacy during the treatment of the following CNS disorders: epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3181/0806-S-195,Central Nervous System Agents/*therapeutic use;Central Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy/genetics;Forecasting;Humans;*Pharmacogenetics;Central Nervous System Diseases;Pharmacogenetics;Nervous System Diseases;Central Nervous System,18849543,

Two, rs9361233 and rs9361235, were significantly associated with clinical improvement after treatment with fluoxetine. The heterozygous genotype combination analysis showed a negative correlation with clinical improvement. The lowest improvement was experienced by patients who were heterozygous for all three SNPs.

Because early response to antipsychotics represents a sufficiently reliable index of the subsequent treatment response in patients with schizophrenia, we undertook a real-world, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the aim of identifying genetic predictors of response to risperidone after 2 weeks in 86 patients with schizophrenia. Limited to the associations reaching significance in the GWAS, confirmatory analysis relative to risperidone response over 9 months was also designed involving 97 patients (European only) enroled in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) genetic substudy. The GWAS revealed a significant association (false discovery rate 0.02) of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2133450 inside the GRM7 gene with Emsley's positive domain derived from the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Patients with the rs2133450 CC genotype presented poorer improvement in the positive domain over 2 weeks, with odds ratios of 12.68 (95% CI, 3.51-45.76) and 6.95 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.37-20.37) compared with patients with the AA and AC genotypes, respectively. Compared with A homozygotes, rs2133450 C homozygotes enroled in the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis showed less improvement in Emsley's positive, excited and depression domains, positive and general PANSS subtypes, and total PANSS after 9 months of treatment with risperidone.

However, as with all pharmacotherapy, patient response is often varied and these novel compounds are not without their own side effect profile, most notably weight gain. Inter-individual variations in response to drug treatment are, in part, due to polymorphisms of the genes encoding drug targets. The importance of the serotonin system in psychiatric symptomatology and several side effects of antipsychotic drugs is well established. Thus genetic polymorphisms of two central 5-HT receptors (5-HT2A and 2C), at which many of the newer antipsychotic drugs act, are prime candidates for pharmacogenetic analysis of the effects of these drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. To date, much work has focussed on the 5-HT2A receptor subtype. However, pharmacological evidence and recent molecular genetic studies would suggest a role for the 5-HT2C receptor in the consequences of antipsychotic treatment, particularly in relation to the development of both drug-induced dyskinesias and weight gain. This review briefly examines the pharmacology and physiology of the 5HT2C receptor in the context of its genetics, with discussion of known polymorphisms of this receptor gene and its promoter region. Associations between these polymorphisms and the development of schizophrenia, the symptom responses to antipsychotic treatment and side effects of such treatment, notably tardive dyskinesia and weight gain, are assessed and related to the presumed functionality of these polymorphisms. Such studies clearly demonstrate the potential of pharmacogenetics in optimising treatment for the individual patient.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2005.03.019,"Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Body Weight/drug effects/genetics;Humans;*Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Genetic;*Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy/genetics;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C/*genetics;Antipsychotic Agents;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic",15953671,

This lack of response is due to several factors, including genetic determinants. Since major depressive disorder is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress abnormalities, the metabolism of superoxide anions might be involved in non-response to antidepressant drugs. Superoxide anions are metabolized by manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in the mitochondria. A functional genetic polymorphism (SOD2, rs4880), responsible of a 40% reduction in enzyme activity, is associated with anti-inflammatory response of rosuvastatin. We investigated the association of ala-allele of SOD2 rs4880 and both antidepressant efficacy and inflammatory parameters in patients treated for a MDE with antidepressant drugs. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score and levels of plasma CRP and inflammatory cytokines were assessed at baseline, one month (M1), 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6) after antidepressant treatment. They were compared according to SOD2 genetic polymorphism. Of the 484 patients studied, 361 (74.6%) carried the ala-allele (Ala group), 123 (25.4%) of them had Val/Val genotype (Val/Val group). No significant difference was observed between the Ala and Val/Val groups neither for baseline clinical characteristics, nor for HDRS scores, response/remission rates, plasma CRP and cytokine levels throughout the study. The rs4880 SOD2 genetic polymorphism was not associated with the clinical response and cytokines levels after antidepressant treatment. These data suggest that SOD2 is not a major genetic determinant of antidepressant response.

METHODS: To detect potential predictor gene variants for risperidone response in schizophrenic subjects, we performed a convergent analysis based on 1) a genomewide (100K SNP) SNP pharmacogenetic study of risperidone response and 2) a global transcriptome study of genes with mRNA levels influenced by risperidone exposure in mouse prefrontal cortex. RESULTS: Fourteen genes were highlighted as of potential relevance to risperidone activity in both studies: ATP2B2, HS3ST2, UNC5C, BAG3, PDE7B, PAICS, PTGFRN, NR3C2, ZBTB20, ST6GAL2, PIP5K1B, EPHA6, KCNH5, and AJAP1. The SNPs related to these genes that were associated in the pharmacogenetic study were further assessed for evidence for association with schizophrenia in up to three case-control series comprising 1564 cases and 3862 controls in total (Japanese [JPN] 1st and 2nd samples and UK sample). Of 14 SNPs tested, one (rs9389370) in PDE7B showed significant evidence for association with schizophrenia in a discovery sample (p(allele) = .026 in JPN_1st, two-tailed). This finding replicated in a joint analysis of two independent case-control samples (p(JPN_2nd+UK) = .008, one-tailed, uncorrected) and in all combined data sets (p(all) = .0014, two-tailed, uncorrected and p(all) = .018, two-tailed, Bonferroni correction). CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel candidate genes for treatment response to risperidone and provide evidence that one of these additionally may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia.

Once the TFs wereidentified, SNPs disrupting the binding sites (TFBS) of these TFs in the genes of each network were selected for genotyping. Finally, SNP-basedassociations with EPS were analyzed in a sample of 356 psychiatric patients receiving AP. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 33 TFs expressed in the striatum, and 125 SNPs disrupting TFBS in 50 genes of our initial networks. Two SNPs (rs938112,rs2987902) in two genes (LSMAP and ABL1) were significantly associated with AP induced EPS (p < 0.001). These SNPs disrupt TFBS regulated byPOU2F1.

Optimization of Clonazepam Therapy Adjusted to Patient's CYP3A Status and NAT2 Genotype.,2016,12,,The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,1469-5111 (Electronic),19,12,,Tóth K and Csukly G and Sirok D and Belic A and Kiss Á and Háfra E and Déri M and Menus Á and Bitter I and Monostory K,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27639091/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The shortcomings of clonazepam therapy include tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and adverse effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, and confusion leading to increased risk of falls. Inter-individual variability in the incidence of adverse events in patients partly originates from the differences in clonazepam metabolism due to genetic and nongenetic factors. METHODS: Since the prominent role in clonazepam nitro-reduction and acetylation of 7-amino-clonazepam is assigned to CYP3A and N-acetyl transferase 2 enzymes, respectively, the association between the patients' CYP3A status (CYP3A5 genotype, CYP3A4 expression) or N-acetyl transferase 2 acetylator phenotype and clonazepam metabolism (plasma concentrations of clonazepam and 7-amino-clonazepam) was evaluated in 98 psychiatric patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. RESULTS: The patients' CYP3A4 expression was found to be the major determinant of clonazepam plasma concentrations normalized by the dose and bodyweight (1263.5±482.9 and 558.5±202.4ng/mL per mg/kg bodyweight in low and normal expressers, respectively, P<.0001). Consequently, the dose requirement for the therapeutic concentration of clonazepam was substantially lower in low-CYP3A4 expresser patients than in normal expressers (0.029±0.011 vs 0.058±0.024mg/kg bodyweight, P<.0001). Furthermore, significantly higher (about 2-fold) plasma concentration ratio of 7-amino-clonazepam and clonazepam was observed in the patients displaying normal CYP3A4 expression and slower N-acetylation than all the others. CONCLUSION: Prospective assaying of CYP3A4 expression and N-acetyl transferase 2 acetylator phenotype can better identify the patients with higher risk of adverse reactions and can facilitate the improvement of personalized clonazepam therapy and withdrawal regimen.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1093/ijnp/pyw083,Acetylation;Adult;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism;Biotransformation;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics;Clonazepam/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics/*metabolism;Drug Monitoring;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;*Pharmacogenomic Variants;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A;Clonazepam;Genotype,27639091,PMC5203763

Genetic variants in cytochrome P450 (CYP) (CYP2D6), dopamine receptor (DRD2, DRD3) and serotonin receptor (HTR2A, HTR2C) genes were previously associated with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia. Our aim was to evaluate whether aripiprazole affects prolactin secretion and its relationship with pharmacogenetics. Thirty-one healthy volunteers receiving a 10-mg single oral dose of aripiprazole were genotyped for 12 polymorphisms in CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A and HTR2C genes by qPCR. Aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Prolactin concentrations of the 31 volunteers taking aripiprazole and 12 volunteers receiving ibuprofen were determined by ELISA. Prolactin concentrations after ibuprofen intake were considered as control, since it is known to cause no effect. Prolactin concentrations were slightly higher in the aripiprazole group compared to the ibuprofen group. All prolactin pharmacokinetic parameters were higher in females than in males. CYP2D6 poor and intermediate metabolizers had notably higher prolactin C(max) and AUC(0-12) than normal and ultrarapid metabolizers. The DRD3 rs6280 polymorphism affected prolactin levels: volunteers carrying Ser/Ser genotype had significantly lower prolactin levels than volunteers carrying the Gly allele. Furthermore, HTR2C rs3813929 C/C homozygotes had significantly lower prolactin levels than T allele carriers.

This contribution investigates the genetics of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, testing 384 candidate gene loci related to the neurobiology of the disease.

We screened all markers for nominal significance and for statistical significance after multiple-testing correction. The most significant single nucleotide polymorphism was the rs2152324 marker in the NALCN gene (P=0.004); however, after the FDR correction, the P-value was not significant. Our analysis of 384 markers across candidate genes did not indicate any robust association with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

The systematic analysis of whole genome sequences to assess patient to patient variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics responses towards drugs would be the next step in future medicine in line with the vision of personalizing medicine. METHODS: Genomic DNA obtained from a 55 years old, self-declared healthy, anonymous male of Malay descent was sequenced. The subject's mother died of lung cancer and the father had a history of schizophrenia and deceased at the age of 65 years old. A systematic, intuitive computational workflow/pipeline integrating custom algorithm in tandem with large datasets of variant annotations and gene functions for genetic variations with pharmacogenomics impact was developed. A comprehensive pathway map of drug transport, metabolism and action was used as a template to map non-synonymous variations with potential functional consequences. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Over 3 million known variations and 100,898 novel variations in the Malay genome were identified. Further in-depth pharmacogenetics analysis revealed a total of 607 unique variants in 563 proteins, with the eventual identification of 4 drug transport genes, 2 drug metabolizing enzyme genes and 33 target genes harboring deleterious SNVs involved in pharmacological pathways, which could have a potential role in clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: The current study successfully unravels the potential of personal genome sequencing in understanding the functionally relevant variations with potential influence on drug transport, metabolism and differential therapeutic outcomes.

We investigated the association of 10 glutamate system gene variants with CLZ response using standard genotyping procedures. GRM2 (rs4067 and rs2518461), SLC1A2 (rs4354668, rs4534557, and rs2901534), SLC6A9 (rs12037805, rs1978195, and rs16831558), GRIA1 (rs2195450), and GAD1 (rs3749034) were typed in 163 European SCZ/schizoaffective disorder patients deemed resistant or intolerant to previous pharmacotherapy. Response was assessed following 6 months of CLZ monotherapy using change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores. Categorical and continuous response variables were analyzed using χ(2) tests and analysis of covariance, respectively. We report no significant associations following correction for multiple testing. Prior to correction, nominally significant associations were observed for SLC6A9, SLC1A2, GRM2, and GRIA1.

METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of individual patient data from the Pharmacogenomic Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study, an 8-week, single-arm clinical trial of citalopram or escitalopram treatment of adults with major depression. We used equipercentile linking to identify levels of absolute and percent change in HDRS-17 scores that equated with scores on the CGI-I at 4 and 8 weeks. Additional analyses equated changes in the HDRS-7 and Bech-6 scale scores with CGI-I scores. RESULTS: A CGI-I score of 2 (much improved) corresponded to an absolute decrease (improvement) in HDRS-17 total score of 11 points and a percent decrease of 50-57%, from baseline values. Similar results were observed for percent change in HDRS-7 and Bech-6 scores. Larger absolute (but not percent) decreases in HDRS-17 scores equated with CGI-I scores of 2 in persons with higher baseline depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the consensus definition of response based on HDRS-17 scores (>50% decrease from baseline). A similar definition of response may apply to the HDRS-7 and Bech-6.

An understanding of the molecular aberrations that cause these mental illnesses requires comprehensive approaches that examine both genetic and epigenetic factors. Because of the overwhelming evidence for the role of environmental factors in the disease presentation, our initial approach involved deciphering how epigenetic changes resulting from promoter DNA methylation affect gene expression in SCZ and BD. Apparently, the central reversible but covalent epigenetic modification to DNA is derived from methylation of the cytosine residues that is potentially heritable and can affect gene expression and downstream activities. Environmental factors can influence DNA methylation patterns and hence alter gene expression. Such changes can be especially problematic in individuals with genetic susceptibilities to specific diseases. Recent reports from our laboratory provided compelling evidence that both hyper- and hypo-DNA methylation changes of the regulatory regions play critical roles in defining the altered functionality of genes in major psychiatric disorders such as SCZ and BD. In this chapter, we outline the technical details of the methods that could help to expand this line of research to assist with compiling the differential methylation-mediated epigenetic alterations that are responsible for the pathogenesis of SCZ, BD, and other mental diseases. We use the genes of the extended dopaminergic (DAergic) system such as membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), dopamine transporter 1 (DAT1), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine (DA) receptors1 and 2 (DRD1/2), and related genes (e.g., reelin [RELN] and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) to illustrate the associations between differential promoter DNA methylations and disease phenotype. It is our hope that comprehensive analyses of the DAergic system as the prototype could provide the impetus and molecular basis to uncover early markers for diagnosis, help in the understanding of differences in disease severity in individuals with similar or identical genetic makeup, and assist with the identification of novel targets for therapeutic applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: book chapter",10.1007/978-1-59745-205-2_9,"*DNA Methylation;DNA Primers;Dopamine/*metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genotype;Humans;Immunoprecipitation;Mental Disorders/*genetics/metabolism;*Molecular Biology;*Pharmacogenetics/methods;Phenotype;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Reelin Protein;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Signal Transduction/*genetics;Sulfites/chemistry;Epigenomics",18370235,

Significant association with MDD was not shown in the alleles and genotypes of single loci or four-locus haplotypes. However, three of the four polymorphisms investigated were significantly associated with 4-week antidepressant therapeutic effect (P=0.002-0.011). Of the four-locus haplotype analysis, the GSK3B TAGT carriers showed a poorer response to antidepressants in 4-week (P<0.0001) and 8-week (P=0.015) evaluation compared with other haplotype groups and would quite likely be the non-remitter to 8-week antidepressant treatment (P=0.006).

As DNMs are not subject to elimination due to evolutionary pressure, they are likely to have greater disruptions on biological functions. While a number of sequencing studies have been performed on neuropsychiatric disorders, the implications of DNMs for drug discovery remain to be explored. In this study, we employed a gene-set analysis approach to address this issue. Four neuropsychiatric disorders were studied, including schizophrenia (SCZ), autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. We first identified gene-sets associated with different drugs, and analyzed whether the gene-set pertaining to each drug overlaps with DNMs more than expected by chance. We also assessed which medication classes are enriched among the prioritized drugs. We discovered that neuropsychiatric drug classes were indeed significantly enriched for DNMs of all four disorders; in particular, antipsychotics and antiepileptics were the most strongly enriched drug classes for SCZ and epilepsy respectively. Interestingly, we revealed enrichment of several unexpected drug classes, such as lipid-lowering agents for SCZ and anti-neoplastic agents. By inspecting individual hits, we also uncovered other interesting drug candidates or mechanisms (e.g. histone deacetylase inhibition and retinoid signaling) that might warrant further investigations. Taken together, this study provided evidence for the usefulness of DNMs in guiding drug discovery or repositioning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2018.12.015,Autism Spectrum Disorder/drug therapy/*genetics;Computational Biology;*Drug Discovery;Epilepsy/drug therapy/*genetics;Humans;Intellectual Disability/drug therapy/*genetics;Mutation;Pharmacogenetics;*Psychotropic Drugs;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics,30597425,

METHODS: In a simulated trial 100,000 subjects in a current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) received citalopram or bupropion based on the clinician's decision (algorithm A) or following indications from 5-HTTLPR genetic testing (algorithm B), which effect size of was estimated from a meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic trials. A and B were compared in a cost-utility analysis (12 weeks). Costs (international $, 2010) were drawn from official sources. Treatment effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs). Outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Under base-case conditions, genetic test use was associated with increases in antidepressant response (0.062 QALWs) and tolerability (0.016 QALWs) but cost benefit was not acceptable (ICER = $2,890; $1,800-$4,091). However, when the joint effect on antidepressant response and tolerability was analyzed in two recurrent episodes, ICER dropped to $1,392 ($837-$1,982).

Both drugs are metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450-2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme and guidelines for dose adaptations based on the CYP2D6 genotype have been developed. The CYP2D6 Screening Among Elderly (CYSCE) trial is designed to address the potential health and economic value of genotyping for CYP2D6 in optimizing dose-finding of nortriptyline and venlafaxine. METHODS/DESIGN: In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder according to the DSM-IV and aged 60 years or older will be recruited from psychiatric centers across the Netherlands. After CYP2D6 genotyping determined in peripheral blood obtained by finger-prick, patients will be grouped into poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers. Patients with deviant genotype (that is poor, intermediate or ultrarapid genotype) will be randomly allocated to an intervention group in which the genotype and dosing advice is communicated to the treating physician, or to a control group in which patients receive care as usual. Additionally, an external reference group of patients with the extensive metabolizer genotype is included. Primary outcome in all groups is time needed to obtain an adequate blood level of the antidepressant drug. Secondary outcomes include adverse drug reactions measured by a shortened Antidepressant Side-Effects Checklist (ASEC), and cost-effectiveness of the screening.

Previous studies focused on the genes of the serotonergic system, leaving apart other pathological factors such as the inflammatory pathway. The main objective of the study was to assess whether treatment response might be associated with specific inflammation-related genetic variants or their methylation status. METHODS: 41 SNPs in 8 inflammatory genes: interleukin (IL) 1-β, IL2, IL6, IL6R, IL10, IL18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ were genotyped in 153 patients with MDD, who were evaluated with the Mausdley Staging Method to determine treatment response profiles. Pyrosequencing reactions and methylation quantification were performed in a PyroMark Q24 in 5 selected CpG islands of IL1- β, IL6 and IL6R. Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted, including age and gender as covariates using PLINK 1.07. RESULTS: Allelic distribution of IL1- β rs1143643 was significantly associated with MSM scores (FDR corrected p = 0.04). Allelic distribution of IL6R rs57569414 showed a trend towards significance with MSM scores (p = 0.002; FDR corrected p = 0.07). Haplotype analyses showed associations between allelic combinations of IL1-β and IL10 with treatment response (FDR corrected p < 0.01). Methylation percentage of treatment responders was only higher in an IL6R CpG island (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory findings suggest that IL1-β and, marginally, IL6R polymorphisms may affect treatment response in major depression. If confirmed, these results may account for the heterogeneous phenotypes of major depression that underlie differences in treatment response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.eurpsy.2019.05.003,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacokinetics;Biomarkers, Pharmacological/*analysis;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Female;Humans;Interleukin-1beta/*genetics;Male;Methylation/drug effects;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptors, Interleukin-6/*genetics;Treatment Outcome;Methylation",31100612,

Although our analysis is confined to static expression data, GRANITE has the capability of evaluating time-course data and generating interactive networks that may shed light on acute versus chronic treatment, as well as evaluating dose response and providing insight into mechanisms that underlie therapeutic versus sub-therapeutic doses or toxic doses. As a proof-of-concept study, we investigated lithium (Li) response in bipolar disorder (BD). BD is a severe mood disorder marked by cycles of mania and depression. Li is one of the most commonly prescribed and decidedly effective treatments for many patients (responders), although its mode of action is not yet fully understood, nor is it effective in every patient (non-responders). In an in vitro study, we compared vehicle versus chronic Li treatment in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) (derived from either responders or non-responders) using both microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA gene expression profiling.

Genetic screening for SSRI drug response among those with major depression: great promise and unseen perils.,2007,,,Depression and anxiety,1091-4269 (Print),24,5,350-7,Rasmussen-Torvik LJ and McAlpine DD,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17096399/,eng,,United States,"This article examines evidence for the potential benefit of genetic testing for SSRI response, as well as potential ethical and practical implications of the implementation of this test into standard psychiatric practice. We reviewed three areas of the literature: the burden of treatment-resistant and treatment-intolerant major depressive disorders, the evidence for the value of genetic testing to predict drug response, and the ethical and practical issues of genetic testing in usual care. Treatment resistance and treatment intolerance are common for persons treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and are associated with both financial and quality-of-life costs. There is strong evidence from association studies that some polymorphisms are associated with SSRI response. However, no randomized trials have yet tested the efficacy of genetic tests to improve outcome in those with treatment resistance or treatment intolerance to SSRIs. Given the nonspecific nature of the test proposed, several ethical concerns are also involved with administering the genetic tests to patients. A randomized trial comparing response in those treated with standard psychiatric care and in those treated with psychiatric care tailored as a result of genetic test results should be completed before the implementation of these tests can be considered. Additionally, the ethical and practical questions concerning the tests must be addressed now, so that the potential impact of these tests on patient care can be well understood prior to adoption in standard practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1002/da.20251,"Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse           effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Drug Resistance/genetics;*Ethics, Medical;Genetic Privacy/ethics;Genetic Testing/*ethics;Genotype;Humans;Patient Compliance;Pharmacogenetics/ethics;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Genetic Testing;Mass Screening",17096399,

METHODS: A Caucasian sample of 70 patients was recruited in 1996-1997 from South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, UK. Subjects had a DSM-IIIR diagnosis of schizophrenia and were treated with typical antipsychotics at doses equivalent to at least 100 mg chlorpromazine daily for at least 12 months prior to assessment. All patients were genotyped for CYP2D6 alleles*3-5, *41, and for amplifications of the gene. RESULTS: There were 13 patients with TD. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) years of duration of antipsychotic treatment in TD-positive was 15.8 (7.9) vs TD-negative 11.1 (7.4) (p=0.04). Increased odds of experiencing TD were associated with increased ability to metabolize CYP2D6, as measured by genotypic category (odds ratio (OR)=4.2), increasing duration in treatment (OR=1.0), and having drug-induced Parkinsonism (OR=9.7). DISCUSSION: We found a significant association between CYP2D6 genotypic category and TD with the direction of effect being an increase in the number of functional CYP2D6 genes being associated with an increased risk of TD. This is the first study to examine the association between TD and CYP2D6 in Caucasians with this number of genotypic categories.

Because of the particular distribution of the protein, the activity of ABCB1 may significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics during absorption and distribution. Of note, several SNPs of ABCB1 are known and many of them affect transporter activity and/or expression. In this view, changes in the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are ABCB1 substrates could be clinically relevant and the evaluation of ABCB1 SNPs should deserve particular attention. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association between ABCB1 polymorphisms and clozapine plasma levels in psychotic patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: c.1236C>T (exon 12), c.2677G>T (exon 21) and c.3435C>T (exon 26) SNPs of ABCB1 were evaluated by PCR techniques, while plasma levels of clozapine and norclozapine were measured by HPLC in 40 men (aged, 47.6 +/- 16.6 years, median: 42 years) and 20 women (aged 40.7 +/- 11.4 years, median: 38 years) 1 month after the start of clozapine administration. RESULTS: A total of three SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with a calculated frequency of the wild-type alleles of 0.54, 0.55 and 0.45 for SNPs on exons 12, 21 and 26, respectively. Patients with c.3435CC or c.2677GG genotypes had significantly lower dose-normalized clozapine levels than those who were heterozygous or TT carriers. More interestingly, c.3435CC patients (15 subjects) needed significantly higher daily doses of clozapine (246 +/- 142 mg/day) compared with the remaining 24 CT and 21 TT patients (140 +/- 90 mg/day) in order to achieve the same clinical benefit. CONCLUSION: c.3435CC patients require higher clozapine doses to achieve the same plasma concentrations as CT or TT patients, and ABCB1 genotyping should be considered as a novel strategy that should improve drug use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.09.51,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics;Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic           use;Clozapine/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Gene Frequency;Haplotypes;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychotic Disorders/blood/*drug therapy/genetics;Schizophrenia/blood/*drug therapy/genetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Clozapine",19663671,

We found four hub genes (ASCC3, PPARGC1B, SCHIP1 and TMTC2) with different connectivity in the initial SSRI treatment period (baseline to week 4) compared with the subsequent period (4-8 weeks after initiation), suggesting that different genetic networks are important at different times during SSRI treatment. The strongest interactions in the initial SSRI treatment period involved genes encoding transcriptional factors, and in the subsequent period genes involved in calcium homeostasis.

The objective of the present analysis was to assess outcomes for the subset of patients expected to benefit from combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing because they were taking medications with predicted gene-drug interactions. METHODS: Participants (enrolled from April 14, 2014, to February 10, 2017) had an inadequate response to at least 1 psychotropic medication in the current episode of MDD. Patients were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) or the guided-care arm, in which clinicians had access to a combinatorial pharmacogenomic test report to inform medication selection. Patients and raters were blinded to study arm through week 8. The following outcomes were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depre​ssion Rating Scale (HDRS-17): symptom improvement (percent change in HDRS-17 score), response (≥ 50% decrease in HDRS-17 score), and remission (HDRS-17 score ≤ 7). In the GUIDED trial, the primary endpoint of symptom improvement did not reach significance in the intent-to-treat cohort (P = .069). Here, a post hoc analysis of patients who were taking medications subject to gene-drug interactions at baseline as predicted by combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing (N = 912) is presented. RESULTS: Among participants taking medications subject to gene-drug interactions at baseline, outcomes at week 8 were significantly improved for those in the guided-care arm compared to TAU (symptom improvement: 27.1% versus 22.1%, P = .029; response: 27.0% versus 19.0%, P = .008; remission: 18.2% versus 10.7%, P = .003). When patients who switched medications were assessed, all outcomes were significantly improved in the guided-care arm compared to TAU (P = .011 for symptom improvement, P = .011 for response, P = .008 for remission). CONCLUSIONS: By identifying and focusing on the patients with predicted gene-drug interactions, use of a combinatorial pharmacogenomic test significantly improved outcomes among patients with MDD who had at least 1 prior medication failure.

Topping the list of candidate genes, we have three genes involved in GABA neurotransmission (GABRA1, GABBR1, and GAD2), one gene involved in glutamate neurotransmission (GRIA2), one gene involved in neuropeptide signaling (TAC1), two genes involved in synaptic function (SYN2 and KCNJ4), six genes involved in myelin/glial function (CNP, MAL, MBP, PLP1, MOBP and GFAP), and one gene involved in lipid metabolism (LPL). These data suggest that schizophrenia is primarily a disorder of brain functional and structural connectivity, with GABA neurotransmission playing a prominent role. These findings may explain the EEG gamma band abnormalities detected in schizophrenia. The analysis also revealed other high probability candidates genes (neurotransmitter signaling, other structural proteins, ion channels, signal transduction, regulatory enzymes, neuronal migration/neurite outgrowth, clock genes, transcription factors, RNA regulatory genes), pathways and mechanisms of likely importance in pathophysiology. Some of the pathways identified suggest possible avenues for augmentation pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia with other existing agents, such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants and lipid modulating agents. Other pathways are new potential targets for drug development. Lastly, a comparison with our earlier work on bipolar disorder illuminates the significant molecular overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1002/ajmg.b.30481,"Animals;Behavior, Animal/drug effects;Biomarkers;Clozapine/pharmacology;Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects;Genetic Linkage;Genomics/*methods;Glutamic Acid/genetics;Humans;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Myelin Sheath/drug effects/genetics;Neurotransmitter Agents/genetics;Phencyclidine/pharmacology;Reproducibility of Results;Schizophrenia/*genetics;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/genetics;Schizophrenia;Genomics;Genome",17266109,

In the present analysis, for the first time a pharmacoepigenetic approach was applied investigating the influence of DNA methylation patterns in the MAO-A regulatory and exon1/intron1 region on antidepressant treatment response. 94 patients of Caucasian descent with major depressive disorder (f = 61; DSM-IV) were analyzed for DNA methylation status at 43 MAO-A CpG sites via direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite treated DNA extracted from blood cells. Patients were also genotyped for the functional MAO-A VNTR. Clinical response to antidepressant treatment with escitalopram was assessed by intra-individual changes of HAM-D-21 scores after 6 weeks of treatment. Apart from two CpG sites, male subjects showed no or only very minor methylation. In female patients, lower methylation at two individual CpG sites in the MAO-A promoter region was nominally associated with impaired response to antidepressant treatment after 6 weeks (GRCh37/hg19: CpG 43.514.063, p = 0.04; CpG 43.514.684, p = 0.009), not, however, withstanding correction for multiple testing. MAO-A VNTR genotypes did not influence MAO-A methylation status. The present pilot data do not suggest a major influence of MAO-A DNA methylation on antidepressant treatment response. However, the presently observed trend towards CpG-specific MAO-A gene hypomethylation-possibly via increased gene expression and consecutively decreased serotonin and/or norepinephrine availability-to potentially drive impaired antidepressant treatment response in female patients might be worthwhile to be followed up in larger pharmacoepigenetic studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00702-014-1227-x,"Analysis of Variance;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Cohort Studies;DNA Methylation/*drug effects/genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*genetics;Exons/drug effects/genetics;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Minisatellite Repeats/drug effects/genetics;Monoamine Oxidase/*genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;Treatment Outcome;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase",24809685,

Ethnicity and treatment response in schizophrenia: a comparison of 3 ethnic groups.,2002,1,,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,0160-6689 (Print),63,1,14-Sep,Emsley RA and Roberts MC and Rataemane S and Pretorius J and Oosthuizen PP and Turner J and Niehaus DJ and Keyter N and Stein DJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11841075/,eng,,United States,"BACKGROUND: Numerous cultural and ethnic factors may directly and indirectly influence treatment outcome in schizophrenia. The present study compared the response to antipsychotic treatment in 3 ethnic groups of patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: Fifty black, 63 mixed descent, and 79 white patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder who were participants in multinational clinical drug trials were assessed by means of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Treatment response was measured by the change in PANSS total scores and the change in positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscale scores from baseline to 6 weeks. Also, the percentage of responders (defined as > or = 40% reduction in PANSS total scores) was calculated for each group. RESULTS: Baseline PANSS scores differed significantly, being higher for black and mixed descent patients. Mixed descent patients showed the greatest mean +/- SD percentage reduction in PANSS total score (29.4 +/- 21.6) followed by black (28.4 +/- 14.7) and white (11.4 +/- 27.6) patients. Analysis of covariance revealed a significant effect of ethnicity on the reduction in PANSS total scores (p < .0001). The numbers of responders were 20 mixed descent (32%), 12 black (24%), and 7 white (9%) patients (p = .002). CONCLUSION: Significant ethnic differences in acute antipsychotic treatment response are demonstrated by this study. Factors such as diet, nutritional status, body mass, and substance use could be important, as well as genetically determined ethnospecific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences. Delayed help-seeking may account for the higher baseline scores in the black and mixed descent patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pharmacogenomic testing",10.4088/jcp.v63n0103,Adult;African Americans/psychology;Age Factors;Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Ethnicity/genetics/*psychology/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Pharmacogenetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Schizophrenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*ethnology;Schizophrenic Psychology;Treatment Outcome;Schizophrenia;Ethnic Groups,11841075,

A previous add-on trial with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) led to negative symptom reductions in chronic patients. We aim to study NAC's impact on symptoms and neurocognition in early psychosis (EP) and to explore whether glutathione (GSH)/redox markers could represent valid biomarkers to guide treatment. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 63 EP patients, we assessed the effect of NAC supplementation (2700 mg/day, 6 months) on PANSS, neurocognition, and redox markers (brain GSH [GSHmPFC], blood cells GSH levels [GSHBC], GSH peroxidase activity [GPxBC]). No changes in negative or positive symptoms or functional outcome were observed with NAC, but significant improvements were found in favor of NAC on neurocognition (processing speed). NAC also led to increases of GSHmPFC by 23% (P = .005) and GSHBC by 19% (P = .05). In patients with high-baseline GPxBC compared to low-baseline GPxBC, subgroup explorations revealed a link between changes of positive symptoms and changes of redox status with NAC. In conclusion, NAC supplementation in a limited sample of EP patients did not improve negative symptoms, which were at modest baseline levels. However, NAC led to some neurocognitive improvements and an increase in brain GSH levels, indicating good target engagement. Blood GPx activity, a redox peripheral index associated with brain GSH levels, could help identify a subgroup of patients who improve their positive symptoms with NAC. Thus, future trials with antioxidants in EP should consider biomarker-guided treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1093/schbul/sbx093,"Acetylcysteine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology;Adolescent;Adult;Antioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology;*Biomarkers;Cognitive Dysfunction/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology;Double-Blind Method;Female;Glutathione/*drug effects;Glutathione Peroxidase;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Male;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Oxidation-Reduction;Prefrontal Cortex/*drug effects/metabolism;Psychotic Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology;Schizophrenia/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology;Young Adult;Biological Markers;Acetylcysteine;Psychotic Disorders",29462456,PMC5815074

Understanding the genetic variation affecting response to antipsychotics is important to develop novel diagnostic tests to match individual schizophrenia patients to the most effective and safe medication. In this study, we use a genome-wide approach to detect genetic variation underlying individual differences in response to treatment with the antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and perphenazine. Our sample consisted of 738 subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia who took part in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness. Subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500 K genotyping platform plus a custom 164 K chip to improve genome-wide coverage. Treatment outcome was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Our criterion for genome-wide significance was a prespecified threshold that ensures that, on an average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. The top statistical result reached significance at our prespecified threshold and involved a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an intergenic region on chromosome 4p15. In addition, SNPs in Ankyrin Repeat and Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-Containing Protein 1B (ANKS1B) and in the Contactin-Associated Protein-Like 5 gene (CNTNAP5), which mediated the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on Negative symptoms, were very close to our threshold for declaring significance. The most significant SNP in CNTNAP5 is nonsynonymous, giving rise to an amino-acid substitution. In addition to highlighting our top results, we provide all P-values for download as a resource for investigators with the requisite samples to carry out replication.

A secondary objective was to analyze 17 other variants in serotonergic system genes (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR1B, HTR2C, TPH1, TPH2) potentially involved in the mechanism of action of venlafaxine. METHOD: The sample included 350 adults age 60 or older with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder and a score of at least 15 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Participants received protocolized treatment with open-label venlafaxine, up to 300 mg/day for approximately 12 weeks, as part of a three-site clinical trial. Each individual was genotyped for 22 polymorphisms in eight genes, which were tested for association with venlafaxine remission (a MADRS score ≤10) and changes in MADRS score during treatment. RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple comparisons, NET variant rs2242446 (T-182C) was significantly associated with remission (odds ratio=1.66, 95% CI=1.13, 2.42). Individuals with the rs2242446 C/C genotype were more likely to remit (73.1%) than those with either the C/T (51.8%) or the T/T genotype (47.3%). Individuals with the C/C genotype also had a shorter time to remission than those with the C/T or T/T genotypes and had a greater percentage change in MADRS score from baseline to end of treatment (up to week 12).

Those genes are ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), the noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin transporters (SLC6A2, SLC6A3 and SLC6A4), cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase type 2 receptor (NTRK2).

Herein, we describe a novel application that employs comprehensive therapeutic drug monitoring of both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications to holistically personalize therapy for complex psychiatry patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,editorial",10.1021/acschemneuro.7b00209,*Drug Monitoring/methods;Humans;Mental Disorders/*drug therapy;Precision Medicine;Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use;Drug Monitoring,28640591,

Symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The phenotypes were response and remission to venlafaxine, non-response (TRDA) and non-remission (TRDB) to neither venlafaxine nor escitalopram. 50 tag SNPs in 14 genes belonging to the pathways of interest were tested for association with phenotypes.

Genome-wide expression profiling of human lymphoblastoid cell lines identifies CHL1 as a putative SSRI antidepressant response biomarker.,2011,2,,Pharmacogenomics,1744-8042 (Electronic),12,2,171-84,Morag A and Pasmanik-Chor M and Oron-Karni V and Rehavi M and Stingl JC and Gurwitz D,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21332311/,eng,,England,"AIMS: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly used class of antidepressants for treating major depression. However, approximately 30% of patients do not respond sufficiently to first-line antidepressant drug treatment and require alternative therapeutics. Genome-wide studies searching for SSRI response DNA biomarkers or studies of candidate serotonin-related genes so far have given inconclusive or contradictory results. Here, we present an alternative transcriptome-based genome-wide approach for searching antidepressant drug-response biomarkers by using drug-effect phenotypes in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). MATERIALS & METHODS: We screened 80 LCLs from healthy adult female individuals for growth inhibition by paroxetine. A total of 14 LCLs with reproducible high and low sensitivities to paroxetine (seven from each phenotypic group) were chosen for genome-wide expression profiling with commercial microarrays. RESULTS: The most notable genome-wide transcriptome difference between LCLs displaying high versus low paroxetine sensitivities was a 6.3-fold lower (p = 0.0000256) basal expression of CHL1, a gene coding for a neuronal cell adhesion protein implicated in correct thalamocortical circuitry, schizophrenia and autism. The microarray findings were confirmed by real-time PCR (36-fold lower CHL1 expression levels in the high paroxetine sensitivity group). Several additional genes implicated in synaptogenesis or in psychiatric disorders, including ARRB1, CCL5, DDX60, DDX60L, ENDOD1, ENPP2, FLT1, GABRA4, GAP43, MCTP2 and SPRY2, also differed by more than 1.5-fold and a p-value of less than 0.005 between the two paroxetine sensitivity groups, as confirmed by real-time PCR experiments. CONCLUSION: Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of in vitro phenotyped LCLs identified CHL1 and additional genes implicated in synaptogenesis and brain circuitry as putative SSRI response biomarkers. This method might be used as a preliminary tool for searching for potential depression treatment biomarkers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: putative antidepressant marker",10.2217/pgs.10.185,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;*Biomarkers, Pharmacological;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cell Line, Tumor;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy;Female;Gene Expression Profiling;Genome, Human/genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Membrane Proteins/*genetics;Paroxetine/pharmacology;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use;Humanities;Humanism;Genome;Genomics;Cell Line",21332311,

RESULTS: Eleven studies with a total of 1775 MDD patients met the inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis. Three common polymorphisms in the 5-HTR2A gene were assessed, including rs6311 C>T, rs7997012 G>A, and rs6313 T>C. Our findings suggested that the 5-HTR2A rs6313 T>C polymorphism was significantly correlated with a higher response rate to antidepressants in MDD patients (allele model: OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.05-1.68, P=0.020; dominant model: OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.21-2.18, P=0.001; homozygous model: OR=1.85, 95% CI=1.18-2.90, P=0.008). The rs7997012 G>A polymorphism was also associated with a higher response rate to antidepressants in MDD patients under the dominant model (OR=1.92, 95% CI=1.02-3.61, P=0.044). However, no significant correlation was found for the 5-HTR2A rs6311 C>T polymorphism under five genetic models (all P>0.05).

Some but not all studies have found that the short form of 5HTTLPR (S allele) results in decreased efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the 5HTTLPR polymorphism influences the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine and paroxetine hydrochloride, 2 frequently prescribed antidepressants with differing pharmacologic profiles, in geriatric depression. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized 8-week study. SETTING: Eighteen academic and private outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: We evaluated 246 cognitively intact patients 65 years or older with major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant therapy with 15 to 45 mg/d of mirtazapine (n = 124) or 20 to 40 mg/d of paroxetine (n = 122). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Geriatric Depression Scale, severity of adverse events and dosing compliance indexes, and discontinuations due to adverse events. Outcome measures were stratified according to 5HTTLPR genotypes. RESULTS: Geriatric Depression Scale scores indicated that S allele carriers treated with paroxetine showed a small impairment in antidepressant response. Among mirtazapine-treated patients, there was little indication that the 5HTTLPR genotype affected antidepressant efficacy. However, the 5HTTLPR polymorphism had a dramatic effect on adverse events. Among paroxetine-treated subjects, S allele carriers experienced more severe adverse events during the course of the study, achieved significantly lower final daily doses, and had more discontinuations at days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 49. Surprisingly, among mirtazapine-treated subjects, S allele carriers had fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, experienced less severe adverse events, and achieved higher final daily doses. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that the S allele of 5HTTLPR at the SLC6A4 locus is associated with a poor outcome after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, the major effect was on the tolerability of these drugs rather than efficacy. Results from mirtazapine-treated patients indicate that the effect of this polymorphism on outcome may depend on the mechanism of antidepressant action.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1001/archpsyc.61.11.1163,"Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use;Aged;Ambulatory Care;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Female;Genetic Markers;Genotype;Humans;Male;Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;Mianserin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use;Mirtazapine;Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics;Paroxetine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Proportional Hazards Models;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Serotonin Agents;Paroxetine",15520364,

Here, we extended the analysis of clinical validity to the combined data from these studies. We also compared the outcome predictions of the combinatorial use of allelic variations in genes for four cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2), the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) with the outcome predictions for the very same subjects using traditional, single-gene analysis. Depression scores were measured at baseline and 8-10 weeks later for the 119 fully blinded subjects who received treatment as usual (TAU) with antidepressant standard of care, without the benefit of pharmacogenomic medication guidance. For another 96 TAU subjects, health-care utilizations were recorded in a 1-year, retrospective chart review. All subjects were genotyped after the clinical study period, and phenotype subgroups were created among those who had been prescribed a GeneSight panel medication that is a substrate for either CYP enzyme or serotonin effector protein. On the basis of medications prescribed for each subject at baseline, the combinatorial pharmacogenomic (CPGx™) GeneSight method categorized each subject into either a green ('use as directed'), yellow ('use with caution') or red category ('use with increased caution and with more frequent monitoring') phenotype, whereas the single-gene method categorized the same subjects with the traditional phenotype (for example, poor, intermediate, extensive or ultrarapid CYP metabolizer). The GeneSight combinatorial categorization approach discriminated and predicted poorer outcomes for red category patients prescribed medications metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 (P=0.0034, P=0.04 and P=0.03, respectively), whereas the single-gene phenotypes failed to discriminate patient outcomes. The GeneSight CPGx process also discriminated health-care utilization and disability claims for these same three CYP-defined medication subgroups. The CYP2C19 phenotype was the only single-gene approach to predict health-care outcomes. Multigenic combinatorial testing discriminates and predicts the poorer antidepressant outcomes and greater health-care utilizations by depressed subjects better than do phenotypes derived from single genes. This clinical validity is likely to contribute to the clinical utility reported for combinatorial pharmacogenomic decision support.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/tpj.2014.85,"Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/*genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;Depression/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology;Female;Humans;Male;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A/genetics;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Treatment Outcome;Phenotype;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents",25686762,

The authors performed a genome-wide association analysis of improvement of depression severity with two antidepressant drugs. METHOD: High-quality Illumina Human610-quad chip genotyping data were available for 706 unrelated participants of European ancestry treated for major depression with escitalopram (N=394) or nortriptyline (N=312) over a 12-week period in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) project, a partially randomized open-label pharmacogenetic trial. RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two intergenic regions containing copy number variants on chromosomes 1 and 10 were associated with the outcome of treatment with escitalopram or nortriptyline at suggestive levels of significance and with a high posterior likelihood of true association. Drug-specific analyses revealed a genome-wide significant association between marker rs2500535 in the uronyl 2-sulphotransferase gene and response to nortriptyline. Response to escitalopram was best predicted by a marker in the interleukin-11 (IL11) gene. A set of 72 a priori-selected candidate genes did not show pharmacogenetic associations above a chance level, but an association with response to escitalopram was detected in the interleukin-6 gene, which is a close homologue of IL11. CONCLUSIONS: While limited statistical power means that a number of true associations may have been missed, these results suggest that efficacy of antidepressants may be predicted by genetic markers other than traditional candidates.

METHODS: Following a 40-minute ketamine infusion (.5 mg/kg), plasma samples were collected at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes and day 1 postinfusion in 67 patients currently experiencing a major depressive episode (MDD, n = 45; BD, n = 22). Concentrations of ketamine, norketamine (NK), dehydronorketamine (DHNK), six hydroxynorketamine metabolites (HNK), and hydroxyketamine (HK) were measured. Plasma concentrations were analyzed by diagnostic group and correlated with patients' depressive, psychotic, and dissociative symptoms. The relationship between cytochrome P450 gene polymorphisms and metabolites, response, and diagnosis was also examined. RESULTS: Ketamine, NK, DHNK, four of six HNKs, and HK were present during the first 230 minutes postinfusion. Patients with BD had higher plasma concentrations of DHNK, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HNK, and (2S,5S;2R,5R)-HNK than patients with MDD, who, in turn, had higher concentrations of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK. Higher (2S,5S;2R,5R)-HNK concentrations were associated with nonresponse to ketamine in BD patients.

The present genome-wide association study was conducted to identify additional genetic markers associated with TESI that may help identify individuals at high risk who may benefit from closer monitoring, alternative treatments, and/or specialty care. METHODS: A clinically representative cohort of outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial were treated with citalopram under a standard protocol for up to 14 weeks. DNA samples from 90 White participants who developed TESI and a sex-matched and race-matched equal number of treated participants who denied any suicidal ideas were genotyped with 109 365 single nucleotide polymorphisms on the Illumina's Human-1 BeadChip. RESULTS: One marker was found to be associated with TESI in this sample at the experiment-wide adjusted P less than 0.05 level (marker rs11628713, allelic P = 6.2x10, odds ratio = 4.7, permutation P = 0.01). A second marker was associated at the experiment-wide adjusted P = 0.06 level (rs10903034, allelic P = 3.02x10, odds ratio = 2.7, permutation P = 0.06). These markers reside within the genes PAPLN and IL28RA, respectively. PAPLN encodes papilin, a protoglycan-like sulfated glycoprotein. IL28RA encodes an interleukin receptor. CONCLUSION: Together with our earlier report, these findings may shed light on the biological basis of TESI and may help identify patients at increased risk of this potentially serious adverse event.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/FPC.0b013e32832e4bcd,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Citalopram/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics/psychology;*Genetic Markers;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Middle Aged;Outpatients;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Retrospective Studies;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Suicide/*psychology/trends;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Genome;Genomics;Suicide;Citalopram",19724244,PMC2819190
Novel sequence variations in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene and association with major depression and antidepressant treatment response.,2009,5,,Archives of general psychiatry,1538-3636 (Electronic),66,5,488-97,Licinio J and Dong C and Wong ML,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19414708/,eng,,,"CONTEXT: Variations in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) have been associated with psychiatric disorders. Deep sequencing of the BDNF gene may identify new variations and bring further insight into psychiatric genetics. OBJECTIVE: To better characterize sequence variability in the BDNF gene by resequencing a genomic DNA region of 22 kilobases that contained all BDNF exons and their flanking regions. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University of California, Los Angeles, and University of Miami. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-four controls and 272 Mexican Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) from Los Angeles who were assessed by the same bilingual clinical research team. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of novel genetic polymorphisms in the BDNF gene and assessment of their frequencies and associations with MDD or antidepressant response. RESULTS: We identified 83 novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 30 in untranslated regions, 4 in coding sequences, 37 in introns, and 12 in upstream regions; 3 of 4 rare novel coding SNPs were nonsynonymous. Association analyses of patients with MDD and controls showed that 6 SNPs were associated with MDD (rs12273539, rs11030103, rs6265, rs28722151, rs41282918, and rs11030101) and 2 haplotypes in different blocks (one including Val66, another near exon VIIIh) were significantly associated with MDD. One recently reported 5' untranslated region SNP, rs61888800, was associated with antidepressant response after adjusting for age, sex, medication, and baseline score on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the concept that extensive resequencing of key candidate genes can lead to the discovery of substantial numbers of new variants. Further studies using larger independent samples are needed to confirm the association of the rs61888800 SNP with antidepressant response.

Norepinephrine and serotonin transporter genes: impact on treatment response in depression.,2010,,,Neuropsychobiology,1423-0224 (Electronic),62,2,121-31,Baffa A and Hohoff C and Baune BT and Müller-Tidow C and Tidow N and Freitag C and Zwanzger P and Deckert J and Arolt V and Domschke K,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20588071/,eng,,Switzerland,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The norepinephrine transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genes constitute promising candidate genes in major depression. Seven polymorphisms in the promoter, intronic and exonic region of the NET gene, as well as serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) and 5-HTT rs25531 polymorphisms were analyzed with respect to antidepressant treatment response with particular attention to gender effects and subtypes of melancholic or anxious depression. METHODS: 252 unrelated Caucasian patients (f = 142; m = 110) with major depression were genotyped for NET and 5-HTT polymorphisms. Genotype effects on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score changes over 6 weeks of antidepressant treatment were analyzed using analysis of covariance with repeated measures. RESULTS: There was no effect of any of the 7 investigated NET, or the two 5-HTT polymorphisms, on the overall treatment response. An additional -/CT insertion/deletion (ins/del) polymorphism (rs58532686), however, was significantly associated with melancholic depression, with a better response in 12 patients carrying the deletion. Stratification for anxious versus nonanxious depression revealed a significantly detrimental effect of the less active 5-HTTLPR S allele (p = 0.007) and 5-HTTLPR/5-HTT rs25531 haplotypes on treatment response in patients with anxious depression. CONCLUSION: The present findings do not support a major impact of the NET and 5-HTT genes on antidepressant treatment response in major depression per se. However, there might be an impact of a -/CT ins/del polymorphism in the enhancer domain of the NET gene on treatment response in melancholic depression, which remains to be functionally investigated in future studies. The observed significant influence of the 5-HTT gene variation on antidepressant treatment in anxious depression points to anxious depression as a potential diagnostic entity of its own, requiring specific diagnostic and therapeutic attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1159/000317285,"Adult;Analysis of Variance;Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;DNA Mutational Analysis/methods;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;Treatment Outcome;Whites;Norepinephrine;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins",20588071,
Association of the adrenergic alpha 2a receptor--1291C/G polymorphism with weight change and treatment response to mirtazapine in patients with major depressive disorder.,2009,3,25,Brain research,1872-6240 (Electronic),1262,,6-Jan,Lee HY and Kang RH and Paik JW and Jeong YJ and Chang HS and Han SW and Lee MS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19401164/,eng,,Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Adrenergic alpha2a receptors (ADRA2A) are expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. The primary mechanism of action of mirtazapine is the antagonism of central presynaptic alpha2 receptors. Mirtazapine is reportedly associated with weight gain. Our objective was to determine whether the ADRA2A -1291C/G polymorphism is associated with weight gain and treatment response to mirtazapine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: The ADRA2A -1291C/G polymorphism was analyzed in 314 MDD patients and 162 control subjects. All patients were evaluated using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the beginning of the study and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of mirtazapine treatment. RESULTS: No relationship was observed between the ADRA2A -1291C/G polymorphism and MDD. No significant difference was found between responder and non-responder groups when comparing the ADRA2A genotype distribution with treatment response to mirtazapine. Repeated measures ANOVA with the last observation carry-forward test indicated that after adjusting for baseline body weight, age, and gender, the subjects with the C/C genotype exhibited a greater mean body weight gain than the subjects with the C/G or G/G genotype after 8 weeks of mirtazapine treatment (p=0.052). CONCLUSIONS: The ADRA2A -1291C/G polymorphism does not appear to be a predictor of treatment response to mirtazapine. This polymorphism was weakly associated with weight change after 8 weeks of mirtazapine treatment.

The authors performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of a genetic test that may identify individuals with greater likelihood of responding to clozapine treatment. We modeled a target population of schizophrenia patients in an acute psychotic episode, using a lifetime time horizon and societal perspective. Outcome measures included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Effects of variations in testing parameters were also examined. For a 30-year-old with schizophrenia, applying the pharmacogenetic test and treating those predicted to respond to clozapine with clozapine-first cost US $47,705 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, compared with treating all patients with conventional agents and reserving clozapine for treatment-resistant patients. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, test sensitivity and cost had the greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness. We conclude that pharmacogenetic tests may achieve utility in clinical psychiatry, although their cost-effectiveness depends on several clinical parameters.

The myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 gene (IMPA2) maps to this genomic region. Myo-inositol monophosphatase dephosphorylates inositol monophosphate, regenerating free inositol. Lithium, a common treatment for BPD, has been shown to inhibit IMPA2 activity and decrease levels of inositol. It is hypothesized that lithium conveys its therapeutic effect for BPD patients partially through inositol regulation. Hence, dysfunction of inositol caused by IMPA2 irregularity may contribute to the pathophysiology of BPD. In this study, we hypothesize that genetic variations in the IMPA2 gene contributes to increased susceptibility to BPD. We tested this hypothesis by genotyping 9 SNPs (rs1787984; rs585247; rs3974759; rs650727; rs589247; rs669838; rs636173; rs3786285; rs613993) in BPD patients (n=556) and controls (n=735). Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between groups using Chi square contingency analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers was calculated and estimated haplotype frequencies were compared between groups. Single marker analysis revealed several associations between IMPA2 variations and BPD, which were subsequently rendered non-significant after correction for multiple testing.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Single-locus as well as detailed haplotype-based association analysis of the COMT gene with schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatment response was carried out using seven COMT polymorphisms in 398 schizophrenia patients and 241 healthy individuals from a homogeneous south Indian population. Further responsiveness to risperidone treatment was assessed in 117 schizophrenia patients using Clinical Global Impressions (CGI).

Recent studies, including our recent findings, have reported that a functional HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism in the promoter region, as well as a nonsynonymous polymorphism, Gly272Asp, may be associated with SSRI pharmacogenetics. In this study, we tested whether Gly272Asp genetic variants are related to a 4-week fluoxetine antidepressant effect in 222 Chinese major depressive patients. We also tested the linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurement between HTR1A Gly272Asp and C-1019G polymorphisms, and haplotype analysis was conducted to assess the association between the two markers within the HTR1A gene and fluoxetine antidepressant response. The results show that the HTR1A Gly272Asp polymorphism was not associated with fluoxetine therapeutic response. The two markers are in strong LD and the HTR1A haplotype of the two polymorphisms is associated with fluoxetine therapeutic response.

Genome-wide association study of a nicotine metabolism biomarker in African American smokers: impact of chromosome 19 genetic influences.,2018,3,,"Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1360-0443 (Electronic),113,3,509-523,Chenoweth MJ and Ware JJ and Zhu AZX and Cole CB and Cox LS and Nollen N and Ahluwalia JS and Benowitz NL and Schnoll RA and Hawk LW Jr and Cinciripini PM and George TP and Lerman C and Knight J and Tyndale RF,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28921760/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The activity of CYP2A6, the major nicotine-inactivating enzyme, is measurable in smokers using the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine). Due to its role in nicotine clearance, the NMR is associated with smoking behaviours and response to pharmacotherapies. The NMR is highly heritable (~80%), and on average lower in African Americans (AA) versus whites. We previously identified several reduce and loss-of-function CYP2A6 variants common in individuals of African descent. Our current aim was to identify novel genetic influences on the NMR in AA smokers using genome-wide approaches. DESIGN: Genome-wide association study (GWAS). SETTING: Multiple sites within Canada and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: AA smokers from two clinical trials: Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction Treatment (PNAT)-2 (NCT01314001; n = 504) and Kick-it-at-Swope (KIS)-3 (NCT00666978; n = 450). MEASUREMENTS: Genome-wide SNP genotyping, the NMR (phenotype) and population substructure and NMR covariates. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis revealed three independent chromosome 19 signals (rs12459249, rs111645190 and rs185430475) associated with the NMR. The top overall hit, rs12459249 (P = 1.47e-39; beta = 0.59 per C (versus T) allele, SE = 0.045), located ~9.5 kb 3' of CYP2A6, remained genome-wide significant after controlling for the common (~10% in AA) non-functional CYP2A6*17 allele. In contrast, rs111645190 and rs185430475 were not genome-wide significant when controlling for CYP2A6*17. In total, 96 signals associated with the NMR were identified; many were not found in prior NMR GWASs in individuals of European descent. The top hits were also associated with the NMR in a third cohort of AA (KIS2; n = 480). None of the hits were in UGT or OCT2 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Three independent chromosome 19 signals account for ~20% of the variability in the nicotine metabolite ratio in African American smokers. The hits identified may contribute to inter-ethnic variability in nicotine metabolism, smoking behaviours and tobacco-related disease risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.1111/add.14032,"Adult;African Americans;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Biomarkers/blood;Canada;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6/*blood/genetics;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods/*statistics & numerical data;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nicotine/*blood/genetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Prospective Studies;Smokers/statistics & numerical data;Smoking/*blood/*genetics;United States;Young Adult;Genome;Genomics;Niacin",28921760,PMC5807179

One possible explanation is the inter-individual differences in antidepressant metabolism due to CYP2C19 and CYP2D6genetic variation. Here, we aimed to determine the potential benefit of pairing CYP2C19 and CYP2D6testing with the five-step STAR*D algorithm. To estimate the proportion of individuals that could benefit from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 testing, we simulated the STAR*D algorithm using ethnicity-specific phenotype (e.g., metabolizer status) frequencies published by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and census data from the Canada and the US. We found that up to one-third of the US and Canadian populations being treated for depression could benefit from the addition of CYP2C19and CYP2D6 genetic testing. The potential benefit varied for each step of the algorithm and for each province, territory, and state. CYP2C19 genotyping had the greatest potential impact within the first two steps of the algorithm, while CYP2D6 genotyping had the most notable impact in Steps 3, 4, and 5.

We have carried out a genomewide association study to determine whether common DNA variation influences antidepressant response. METHODS: Our sample is derived from Level 1 participants in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, all treated with citalopram. Association for the response phenotype included 883 responders and 608 nonresponders. For the remission phenotype, 743 subjects that achieved remission were compared with 608 nonresponders. We used a subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n = 430,198) from the Affymetrix 500K and 5.0 Human SNP Arrays, and association analysis was carried out after correcting for population stratification. RESULTS: We identified three SNPs associated with response with p values less than 1 x 10(-5) near the UBE3C gene (rs6966038, p = 4.65 x 10(-7)), another 100 kb away from BMP7 (rs6127921, p = 3.45 x 10(-6)), and a third that is intronic in the RORA gene (rs809736, p = 8.19 x 10(-6)). These same SNPs were also associated with remission. Thirty-nine additional SNPs are of interest with p values < or = .0001 for the response and remission phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings reported here do not meet a genomewide threshold for significance, the regions identified from this study provide targets for independent replication and novel pathways to investigate mechanisms of antidepressant response. This study was not placebo controlled, making it possible that we are also observing associations to nonspecific aspects of drug treatment of depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.08.029,"Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use;Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7/genetics;Citalopram/*therapeutic use;Cluster Analysis;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Male;Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1/genetics;Odds Ratio;*Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Sex Factors;Statistics as Topic;Treatment Outcome;Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Citalopram",19846067,PMC2794921

There is presently no curative treatment or definitive predictive test for tardive dyskinesia. The authors note that the three antipsychotic drugs enlisted in the most recent (14th) World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines--chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and haloperidol--belong to the FGA therapeutic class. In this regard, the need to choose between the competing objectives of ensuring global access to affordable and efficacious medicines, such as FGAs, and the formidable long-term risk for tardive dyskinesia, may create an ethical conundrum. Pharmacogenetics has thus far been conceptually framed as a tool to individualize therapy with new drugs under patent protection. However, the authors suggest that pharmacogenetics may also improve access to pharmacotherapy through the reintroduction of affordable second-line generic drugs or FGAs with suboptimal safety, as first-line therapy, in targeted subpopulations in whom they present a lower risk for tardive dyskinesia. To impact positively on global public health and distributive justice, a directory complementary to the essential medicines library--one that enlists the 'essential biomarkers' required for optimal pharmacotherapy--may benefit patients who do not have adequate access to new antipsychotic medications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed GWAS to search for genetic variation affecting treatment response. The analysis sample included 738 patients with schizophrenia, successfully genotyped for ∼492k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness. Outcomes included both clinician and patient report of illness severity on global impression scales, the clinical global impression severity scale and patient global impression, respectively. Our criterion for genome-wide significance was a prespecified threshold ensuring that, on average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. RESULTS: Thirteen SNPs reached genome-wide significance. The top findings indicated three SNPs in PDE4D, 5q12.1 (P=4.2×10, 1.6×10, 1.8×10), mediating the effects of quetiapine on patient-reported severity and an additional three SNPs in TJP1, 15q13.1 (P=2.25×10, 4.86×10, 4.91×10), mediating the effects of risperidone on patient-reported severity. For clinician-reported severity, two SNPs in PPA2, 4q24 (P=3.68×10, 5.05×10), were found to reach genome-wide significance. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of both a novel and a consistent association when examining the results from the patient and clinician ratings, suggesting that different raters may capture unique facets of schizophrenia.

In this study, the relationship between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database ID: rs6265) and severity of depression, efficacy of fluoxetine and its side effects was tested in Chinese patients with MDD. METHODS: Patients with MDD took the oral selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Its clinical efficacy and side effects were measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Treatment-Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS), respectively. The patients were genotyped for Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene. RESULTS: In the multivariate regression analysis, there was no significant association between severity of depression and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. There was no association between efficacy of fluoxetine and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, but there was a marginal positive suggestion that heterozygous patients tended to have a better remission with fluoxetine in comparison with homozygous analogs. Insomnia and decreased sexual desire, side effects of fluoxetine, may have an association with the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, and Met allele carriers showed a lower incidence of these side effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that there was a lack of association between severity of depression and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in Chinese patients with MDD.

Clozapine has been shown to be effective in about one-third of patients, but the medical risks and weekly blood tests limit its broad application. While the heterogeneity of the disease and the duration of untreated psychosis are important, pharmacogenomic aspects must also be considered. Pharmacogenomic investigations offer the opportunity to individualize antipsychotic therapy according to the growing knowledge of the function and effect of the genetic polymorphisms that affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antipsychotics. On the pharmacokinetic level, polymorphic phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins affect drug concentration at the target structure. The cytochrome P450 enzymes, N-acetyltransferase, and multidrug resistance protein (MDR1) particularly influence this parameter. Genetic alterations affecting drug pharmacodynamic properties have an impact on therapeutic outcome that is generally independent of the applied dosage regimen. A combined analysis of genetic polymorphisms in the dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, neurotransmitter transporters, and other target structures involved in psychiatric disorders is already a powerful predictor of therapeutic outcome. An understanding of other factors influencing gene expression and protein production will facilitate individualized therapy in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.31887/DCNS.2004.6.1/mackenheil,Schizophrenia;Antipsychotic Agents;Pharmacogenetics,22034253,PMC3181786

We estimated the costs and benefits of a putative pharmacogenetic test for antidepressant response in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) from the societal perspective. Specifically, we performed cost-effectiveness analyses using state-transition probability models incorporating probabilities from the multicenter STAR*D effectiveness study of MDD. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared for sequential antidepressant trials, with or without guidance from a pharmacogenetic test for differential response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Likely SSRI responders received an SSRI, whereas likely nonresponders received the norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion. For a 40-year old with MDD, applying the pharmacogenetic test and using the non-SSRI bupropion for those at higher risk for nonresponse cost $93,520 per additional QALY compared with treating all patients with an SSRI first and switching sequentially in the case of nonremission. Cost per QALY dropped below $50,000 for tests with remission rate ratios as low as 1.5, corresponding to odds ratios approximately 1.8-2.0. Tests for differential antidepressant response could thus become cost effective under certain circumstances. These circumstances, particularly availability of alternative treatment strategies and test effect sizes, can be estimated and should be considered before these tests are broadly applied in clinical settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: economic analysis",10.1038/npp.2009.50,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/*economics/therapeutic use;Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/economics/genetics;Female;*Health Care Costs;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Statistical;Pharmacogenetics/*economics/methods;Quality of Life;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*economics/therapeutic use;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents",19494805,PMC3312011

However, a high percentage of patients do not respond. There is a substantial genetic contribution to this variable clinical outcome. Based on previous genetic results of our group and given the lack of pharmacogenetics studies of antidepressant response with a long follow-up period, we evaluated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to the serotonergic pathway on remission and recovery in children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD after 12 months of initiating fluoxetine treatment. Methods: The assessment was performed in 46 patients. All of them were visited at least once a month during the 12-month follow-up. Psychiatrists interviewed patients and their parents to explore clinical improvement. A total of 75 genotyped SNPs in 10 candidate genes were included in the genetic association analysis with remission and recovery. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied to avoid false positive results. Results: The HTR2A rs7997012 SNP was significantly associated after Bonferroni correction with clinical improvement. Particularly, the homozygotes for the major allele (GG) showed the highest percentage of remitters and the highest score reductions on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Moreover, although the results were on the border of statistical significance, the GG homozygotes also tended to experience fewer readmissions during the follow-up period Conclusions: These results provide more evidence of the involvement of genetic variants related to the serotonergic pathway in the antidepressant response.

Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in schizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotics genotyped for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T and 1298A/C variants.,2008,1,,Schizophrenia research,0920-9964 (Print),98,1,47-54,Ellingrod VL and Miller DD and Taylor SF and Moline J and Holman T and Kerr J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17976958/,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: The metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance represent growing concerns related to atypical antipsychotic (AAP) use as their incidence in the schizophrenia population is two-to-four-fold higher than the general population. Reduced methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) activity, resulting in aberrant folate metabolism and hyperhomocysteinemia, has been linked to cardiovascular disease and is unstudied in relation to AAP associated metabolic complications. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between MTHFR, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance in schizophrenia subjects receiving AAPs for >or=12 months. METHODS: Fifty-eight subjects were included in this cross-sectional analysis and screened for the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and MTHFR 677C/T and 1298A/C genotype. RESULTS: Overall, 23 subjects (40%) met metabolic syndrome criteria. There were no differences in age, gender, race, or AAP exposure between genotype groups. For the 677 T allele carriers, 53% met metabolic syndrome criteria, compared to 23% in the CC genotype group, giving an OR=3.7, (95% CI=1.24-12.66, p=0.02). Thus, for T allele subjects, the risk was almost four times greater, despite similar antipsychotic exposure. Both waist circumference and MTHFR genotype significantly predicted insulin resistance (F=8.35, df=5, 51, p<0.0001), with these two terms interacting (F=8.6, df=2, p=0.0006) suggesting that TT subjects are at greater risk for insulin resistance with increasing central adiposity, which is independent of age, gender, BMI, or metabolic syndrome diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Results should be taken cautiously due to the small sample size, but suggest the MTHFR 677C/T variant may predispose patients to AAP metabolic complications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.schres.2007.09.030,Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Genetic Variation/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Insulin Resistance/*genetics;Male;Metabolic Syndrome/*chemically induced/genetics;Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics/metabolism;Pharmacogenetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics;Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2);Insulin Resistance;Schizophrenia,17976958,PMC2271139

However, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of NMB from antidepressants. Methods: Equipercentile linking was used to identify a threshold for percent change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) scores that equated with a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 3 (minimally improved), a proxy for NMB, after 4 and 8 weeks of citalopram or escitalopram treatment, using data from the Pharmacogenomic Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS). The NMB threshold for the HDRS-17 was validated by equating a CGI-I rating of 3 with percent change values from the clinician- and patient-rated versions of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C and QIDS-SR) using data from PGRN-AMPS and phase 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial. This study was conducted between June 2021 and September 2021. Results: In PGRN-AMPS, a 30% improvement in HDRS-17 score corresponded to a CGI-I rating of 3 at 4 and 8 weeks. The 30% improvement threshold was also observed for QIDS-C and QIDS-SR scores in both PGRN-AMPS and STAR*D. Similar results were observed for percent change in HDRS-17 and QIDS-based measures in lower- and higher-severity groups based on a median split of baseline total scores. Conclusions: Improvement in depressive severity of ≤ 30%, as assessed using the HDRS-17, QIDS-C, and QIDS-SR, may validly define NMB from antidepressants during short-term treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.4088/JCP.21m14239,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Citalopram/therapeutic use;Clinical Trials as Topic;*Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy;Humans;Pharmacogenetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Treatment Outcome;Cross-Over Studies;Antidepressive Agents",35771974,

However, there are some inconsistencies in replicating findings between studies of different countries. The failure to replicate these findings may result from genetic factors that could explain some of the variability in the treatment response. However, pharmacogenetic studies exploring this topic in women with schizophrenia are lacking. We aimed to conduct an exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis of a double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks' duration of raloxifene aiming to improve negative symptoms in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were studied: rs9340799, rs2234693 and rs1801132 in the Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) gene, and rs1042597 in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A8 (UGT1A8) gene. Sixty-five postmenopausal women with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) were randomized to either 60mg/day adjunctive raloxifene (36 women) or adjunctive placebo (29 women). Psychopathological symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Of the four studied SNPs, the rs1042597 variant in the UGT1A8 gene was associated with a different treatment response in negative symptoms with raloxifene treatment, whereas the rs2234693 variant in the ESR1 gene was associated with a distinct response in general psychopathology. In conclusion, our study suggests that genetic variants in UGT1A8 and ESR1 genes modulate the treatment response to adding raloxifene to antipsychotic treatment in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.08.006,"Age of Onset;Aged;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Double-Blind Method;Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics;Female;Genotype;Glucuronosyltransferase/genetics;Humans;Middle Aged;*Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Postmenopause/psychology;Raloxifene Hydrochloride/*adverse effects;*Schizophrenia;*Schizophrenic Psychology;Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*adverse effects;Schizophrenia;Postmenopause;Pharmacogenetics;Raloxifene",27546373,

However, less is known about genetic control over component working memory cortical-subcortical networks in humans, and the pharmacogenetic implications of dopamine-related genes on cognition in patients receiving anti-dopaminergic drugs. Here, we examined predictions from basic models of dopaminergic signalling in cortical and cortical-subcortical circuitries implicated in dissociable working memory maintenance and manipulation processes. We also examined pharmacogenetic effects on cognition in the context of anti-dopaminergic drug therapy. Using dynamic causal models of functional magnetic resonance imaging in normal subjects (n = 46), we identified differentiated effects of functional polymorphisms in COMT, DRD2 and AKT1 genes on prefrontal-parietal and prefrontal-striatal circuits engaged during maintenance and manipulation, respectively. Cortical synaptic dopamine monitored by the COMT Val158Met polymorphism influenced prefrontal control of both parietal processing in working memory maintenance and striatal processing in working memory manipulation. DRD2 and AKT1 polymorphisms implicated in DRD2 signalling influenced only the prefrontal-striatal network associated with manipulation. In the context of anti-psychotic drugs, the DRD2 and AKT1 polymorphisms altered dose-response effects of anti-psychotic drugs on cognition in schizophrenia (n = 111). Thus, we suggest that genetic modulation of DRD2-AKT1-related prefrontal-subcortical circuits could at least in part influence cognitive dysfunction in psychosis and its treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1093/brain/aws068,"Adolescent;Adult;Brain/blood supply/drug effects/*pathology;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics;Dopamine Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Female;Genotype;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Intelligence Tests;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Memory Disorders/etiology/*genetics/pathology;Memory, Short-Term/drug effects/*physiology;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Neural Pathways/blood supply/pathology;Neuropsychological Tests;Nonlinear Dynamics;Oxygen/blood;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism;Receptors, Dopamine D2/genetics;Schizophrenia/complications/genetics;Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology;Young Adult;Memory, Short-Term",22525159,PMC3338927

The reasons for the low response and remission rates are multiple and depend on environmental and biological factors intrinsic to the disease and drug treatments. Pharmacogenetic (PG) tests have the potential to increase efficacy predicting outcome and to reduce antidepressant discontinuation due to side effects. Several studies investigated the utility of PG tests for antidepressants in MDD with interesting but contrasting results. To date most of them are observational studies with no comparator group, and few are randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The aim of this review is to provide an evaluation of the state of art on clinical methodologic features of RCTs with PG tests for antidepressant drugs in MDD, offering suggestions and favoring new insights that could be useful in the implementation of future trials. Several limitations concerning study design, generalization of results, duration of trials, patients group studied, and cost-effectiveness ratio were found, and a number of barriers have been noted in the adoption of PG tests into clinical practice. Despite some preliminary positive results, there is the need for larger and longer-term RCT studies, with the goal to capture the real impact of PG tests, also with stratified analysis concerning MDD features in terms of severity and antidepressant treatment failures in different ethnicity cohorts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.euroneuro.2022.04.007,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Humans;*Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Treatment Outcome;Pharmacogenetics;Antidepressive Agents",35561539,

A functional polymorphism in this gene (C825T) has been associated with response to antidepressants. Several lines of evidence suggest that GNB3 moderates improvement in the neurovegetative symptoms of depression (such as sleep and appetite) and related adverse reactions independently of change in core mood symptoms. We here report analysis of data from GENDEP, a part-randomized pharmacogenomic trial, on the outcome of 811 subjects with major depression undergoing treatment with either escitalopram or nortriptyline in which the C825T SNP and three further SNPs in GNB3 were genotyped. The TT genotype was significantly associated with a superior response to nortriptyline and these effects were specific to improvements in neurovegetative symptoms. In addition, the same genotype predicted fewer incidents of treatment-emergent insomnia and greater weight gain on the same drug.

METHODS: To investigate whether common genetic variation in the SERPINE1 gene is associated with MDD and the therapeutic response to antidepressants, six polymorphisms (rs2227631, rs1799889, rs6092, rs6090, rs2227684 and rs7242) of the SERPINE1 gene were genotyped in 188 Chinese MDD patients and 346 controls.

RESULTS: In single-marker-based analysis, the rs2227684-G and rs7242-T alleles were more frequent in MDD patients than in controls (P=0.010 and 0.010, respectively). The haplotype derived from the rs6090-G, rs2227684-G and rs7242-T polymorphisms was 1.19-fold higher in patients with MDD than in controls (P=0.0038).

We investigated 1,903 MDD patients from the STAR*D study. Outcome was the number of severe depressive records, defined as a Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS)-Clinician rated (C) total score >15, corrected for the number of observations for each patient during the first 14 weeks of citalopram treatment.

SNPs were analyzed in groups (molecular pathway analysis) testing the hypothesis that the distribution of significant (p < 0.05) associations between SNPs and the outcome segregates within each pathway/gene subset. The best associated results are relative to two signle SNPs, (rs7744492 in AKAP12 p = 0.0004 and rs17046113 in CAMK2D p = 0.0006) and a molecular pathway (cAMP biosynthetic process p = 0.005).

Based on previous suggestive evidence of an impact on clozapine response in patients with schizophrenia, we conducted an association study of NRXN1 polymorphisms (rs12467557 and rs10490162) with antipsychotic treatment response in 54 patients with schizophrenia in a double blind, placebo-controlled NIMH inpatient crossover trial and examined for association with risk for schizophrenia in independent case-control and family-based clinical cohorts. Pharmacogenetic analysis in the placebo controlled trial revealed significant association of rs12467557and rs10490162 with drug response, whereby individuals homozygous for the A allele, at either SNP, showed significant improvement in positive symptoms, general psychopathology, thought disturbance, and negative symptoms, whereas patients carrying the G allele showed no overall response. Although we did not find evidence of the same NRXN1 SNPs being associated with results of the NIMH sponsored CATIE trial, other SNPs showed weakly positive signals. The family and case-control analyses for schizophrenia risk were negative. Our results provide confirmatory evidence of genetically determined differences in drug response in patients with schizophrenia related to NRXN1 variation.

CONCLUSIONS: The CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype appears to be associated with risperidone ADRs and discontinuation due to ADRs; however, this finding requires further study in larger patient populations. The CYP3A5 and p-glycoprotein exon 21 and 26 genotypes were not significantly associated with risperidone response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.4088/jcp.v66n0103,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Basal Ganglia Diseases/chemically induced/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism/therapeutic use;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Therapy, Combination;Female;Genetic Variation;Genotype;Humans;Logistic Models;Male;Mental Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Patient Dropouts;Pharmacogenetics;*Phenotype;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Risperidone/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism;Risperidone;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Phenotype",15669884,
Common functional mineralocorticoid receptor polymorphisms modulate the cortisol awakening response: Interaction with SSRIs.,2011,5,,Psychoneuroendocrinology,1873-3360 (Electronic),36,4,484-94,Klok MD and Vreeburg SA and Penninx BW and Zitman FG and de Kloet ER and DeRijk RH,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20884124/,eng,,England,"BACKGROUND: Cortisol controls the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during stress and during the circadian cycle through central mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Changes in MR and GR functioning, therefore, may affect HPA axis activity. In this study we examined the effect of common functional MR gene variants on the cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is often disturbed in stress-related disorders like depression. METHODS: Common functional MR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; MR -2G/C and I180V) and haplotypes were tested for association with variability in the CAR in a large cohort (Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, NESDA) of patients diagnosed with a lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD). Saliva cortisol measurements and genotypes could be obtained from a total of 1026 individuals, including 324 males and 702 females. RESULTS: The MR -2C/C genotype was associated with an attenuated CAR increase in women (p=.03) but not in men (p=.18; p=.01 for SNP-by-sex interaction). The MR I180V SNP had no significant effect on the CAR. Additional analysis revealed that effect of the -2G/C SNP on the CAR was due to an interaction with frequent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Only in subjects using SSRIs (men and women) highest total morning cortisol levels were observed in -2G/G carriers, while the CAR was completely flattened in women with the -2C/C genotype (p<.05). The results were independent of multiple potential confounders and had an effect size of r=.14-.27. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the MR -2G/C SNP modulated the CAR only in the MDD patients using SSRIs, with a clear allele-dose effect in women. This suggests that effect of SSRIs on cortisol regulation depends in part on the MR genotype with possible implications for future treatment selection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.07.024,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Arousal/*genetics/physiology;Cohort Studies;Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Humans;Hydrocortisone/*metabolism;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/physiology;Receptors, Mineralocorticoid/*genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use;Wakefulness/genetics/physiology;Young Adult;Hydrocortisone;Polymorphism, Genetic;Mineralocorticoids",20884124,

Besides drugs, genetic and clinical factors may contribute to QTc prolongation. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of candidate genes known for QTc prolongation and their interaction with common antipsychotics. Thus, 199 patients were genotyped for nine polymorphisms in KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, LOC10537879, LOC101927066, NOS1AP and NUBPL. QTc interval duration was measured before treatment and weekly for 5 weeks while being treated with risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, amisulpride, aripiprazole and haloperidol in monotherapy. Antipsychotics used in this study showed a different potential to affect the QTc interval. We found no association between KCNH2, KCNQ1, LOC10537879, LOC101927066, NOS1AP and NUBPL polymorphisms and QTc duration at baseline and during antipsychotic treatment. Mixed general models showed a significant overall influence of SCN5A (H558R) on QTc duration but no significant interaction with antipsychotic treatment. Our results do not provide evidence for an involvement of candidate genes for QTc duration in the pathophysiology of QTc prolongation by antipsychotics during short-term treatment. Further association studies are needed to confirm our findings. With a better understanding of these interactions the cardiovascular risk of patients may be decreased.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00406-018-0880-8,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Double-Blind Method;Electrocardiography;Female;Genotype;Germany;Humans;Long QT Syndrome/*chemically induced/*genetics;Male;Middle Aged;NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel/*genetics;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Regression Analysis;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Time Factors;Young Adult;Schizophrenia",29429138,

METHOD: A total of 232 Mexican Americans who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with desipramine (50-200 mg/day) or fluoxetine (10-40 mg/day) after a 1-week placebo lead-in period. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. At week 8, whole-exome genotyping data were obtained for 36 participants who remitted and 29 who did not respond to treatment. RESULTS: Compared with desipramine treatment, fluoxetine treatment was associated with a greater reduction in HAM-D score, higher response and remission rates, shorter time to response and remission, and lower incidences of anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects. Pharmacogenetics analysis showed that exm-rs1321744 achieved exome-wide significance for treatment remission. This variant is located in a brain methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing site, which suggests that it may be involved in epigenetic regulation of neuronal gene expression. This and two other common gene variants provided a highly accurate cross-validated predictive model for treatment remission of major depression (receiver operating characteristic integral=0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with desipramine, fluoxetine treatment showed a more rapid reduction of HAM-D score and a lower incidence of side effects in a population comprising primarily first-generation Mexican Americans with major depression. This study's pharmacogenetics approach strongly implicates the role of functional variants in antidepressant treatment response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.12091165,"Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Adult;Aged;Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology;Desipramine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Double-Blind Method;Drug Administration Schedule;Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Fluoxetine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Male;*Mexican Americans;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Predictive Value of Tests;Prospective Studies;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Research Design;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Brain;Mexican Americans;Methylation;Genome;Antidepressive Agents;Genomics",25220861,PMC5746054

This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to evaluate the utility of pharmacogenetic tests (PGT) in terms of efficacy and tolerability into the routine clinical treatment of mood disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first part of the review is a qualitative overview of the PGTs used in the included studies. The second part aims to compare, in terms of efficacy and tolerability, patients affected by BD and MDD treated as usual (TAU), according to the clinicians' prescribing attitude, versus patients whose psychopharmacological treatments were set up following the PGT suggestions. RESULTS: 6 studies on MDD and 2 studies on BD were included. Regarding MDD, the meta-analysis shows a significantly higher number of patients achieving better outcome in terms of efficacy, through the evaluation of response rate and remission rate at the HDRS (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) in the group of patients treated under the PGT suggestions; regarding BD the meta-analysis does not show any significant difference in terms of efficacy. In terms of adverse events, the available data suggest promising results about the utility of PGT to set more tolerated therapies.

Applicability of a genetic signature for enhanced iloperidone efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia.,2009,6,,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,1555-2101 (Electronic),70,6,801-9,Volpi S and Potkin SG and Malhotra AK and Licamele L and Lavedan C,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19573479/,eng,,United States,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how several polymorphisms previously associated with the efficacy of the novel antipsychotic iloperidone could be used together to predict clinical response and provide practical information for individualized treatment. METHOD: This inpatient randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ziprasidone-controlled, 28-day study of the efficacy of iloperidone was conducted from November 2005 to September 2006. Likelihood ratios, predicted probabilities of response, and number needed to treat were calculated for patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) using 6 genetic markers of iloperidone response as measured by change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Total (PANSS-T) score. Data analysis was performed on 409 patients of various ethnic origins. RESULTS: The 6-marker genotype combinations defined 4 groups of patients with distinct probabilities of response. More than 75% of iloperidone-treated patients in the group with the optimal genotype combinations showed a 20% or greater improvement, compared with 37% for patients with other genotypes. These patients had a significant response by the first week of treatment, which was earlier than for patients with other genotype combinations. The odds of responding to iloperidone treatment with at least 20% improvement ranged from 2.4 to 3.6 for patients with 1 of the 6 favorable single-marker genotypes. The odds increased to 9.5 or greater for patients with the most favorable 6-marker combinations. The difference in PANSS-T score improvement observed between the genotype groups was also seen for the positive, negative, and general psychopathology PANSS subscales. The relationship between treatment efficacy and genotype combinations was not observed for patients treated with ziprasidone. CONCLUSION: These results illustrate the combined use of genetic markers to predict enhanced response to iloperidone and support the application of pharmacogenetics to differentiate medication options and improve individualized treatments for schizophrenia.

We aimed to examine whether CRTC1 polymorphisms were associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and to test the association of these polymorphisms with obesity markers in several large case-control samples with MDD. METHODS: The association between CRTC1 polymorphisms and MDD was investigated in three case-control samples with MDD (PsyCoLaus n1=3,362, Radiant n2=3,148 and NESDA/NTR n3=4,663). The effect of CRTC1 polymorphisms on obesity markers was then explored. RESULTS: CRTC1 polymorphisms were not associated with MDD in the three samples. CRTC1 rs6510997C>T was significantly associated with fat mass in the PsyCoLaus study. In fact, a protective effect of this polymorphism was found in MDD cases (n=1,434, β=-1.32%, 95% CI -2.07 to -0.57, p<0.001), but not in controls. In the Radiant study, CRTC1 polymorphisms were associated with BMI, exclusively in individuals with MDD (n=2,138, β=-0.75kg/m(2), 95% CI -1.30 to -0.21, p=0.007), while no association with BMI was found in the NESDA/NTR study. LIMITATIONS: Estimated fat mass using bioimpedance that capture more accurately adiposity was only present in the PsyCoLaus sample. CONCLUSIONS: CRTC1 polymorphisms seem to play a role with obesity markers in individuals with MDD rather than non-depressive individuals. Therefore, the weak association previously reported in the population-based samples was driven by cases diagnosed with lifetime MDD.

Next-generation sequencing of pharmacogenes: a critical analysis focusing on schizophrenia treatment.,2013,12,,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,1744-6880 (Electronic),23,12,666-74,Drögemöller BI and Wright GE and Niehaus DJ and Emsley R and Warnich L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24141736/,eng,,United States,"INTRODUCTION: Because of the unmet needs of current pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia, antipsychotic pharmacogenetic research is of utmost importance. However, to date, few clinically applicable antipsychotic pharmacogenomic alleles have been identified. Nonetheless, next-generation sequencing technologies are expected to aid in the identification of clinically significant variants for this complex phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to critically examine the ability of next-generation sequencing technologies to reliably detect variation present in pharmacogenes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Candidate antipsychotic pharmacogenes and very important pharmacogenes were identified from the literature and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase. Thereafter, the percentage sequence similarity observed between these genes and their corresponding pseudogenes and paralogues, as well as the percentage low-complexity sequence and GC content of each gene, was calculated. These sequence attributes were subsequently compared with the 'inaccessible' regions of these genes as described by the 1000 Genomes Project. RESULTS: It was found that the percentage 'inaccessible genome' correlated well with GC content (P=9.96×10), low-complexity sequence (P=0.0002) and the presence of pseudogenes/paralogues (P=8.02×10). In addition, it was found that many of the pharmacogenes were not ideally suited to next-generation sequencing because of these genomic complexities. These included the CYP and HLA genes, both of which are of importance to many fields of pharmacogenetics. CONCLUSION: Current short read sequencing technologies are unable to comprehensively capture the variation in all pharmacogenes. Therefore, until high-throughput sequencing technologies advance further, it may be necessary to combine next-generation sequencing with other genotyping strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/FPC.0000000000000006,"Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Computational Biology;Databases, Bibliographic;Databases, Genetic;*Genetic Variation;Genome, Human;*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Humans;Pharmacogenetics/methods;Pseudogenes;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods;Schizophrenia",24141736,

Genetic factors and clinical characteristics contribute to the failure of a favorable treatment outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic and clinical determinants of antidepressant drug treatment outcome in depression. DESIGN: Genomewide pharmacogenetic association study with 2 independent replication samples. SETTING: We performed a genomewide association study in patients from the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature (MARS) project and in pooled DNA from an independent German replication sample. A set of 328 single-nucleotide polymorphisms highly related to outcome in both genomewide association studies was genotyped in a sample of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 339 inpatients with a depressive episode (MARS sample), a further 361 inpatients with depression (German replication sample), and 832 outpatients with major depression (STAR*D sample). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We generated a multilocus genetic variable that described the individual number of alleles of the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with beneficial treatment outcome in the MARS sample (""response"" alleles) to evaluate additive genetic effects on antidepressant drug treatment outcome. RESULTS: Multilocus analysis revealed a significant contribution of a binary variable that categorized patients as carriers of a high vs low number of response alleles in the prediction of antidepressant drug treatment outcome in both samples (MARS and STAR*D). In addition, we observed that patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder combined with a low number of response alleles showed the least favorable outcome.

This review discusses the role of sex in coronary artery disease, schizophrenia, and depression--complex multigenic disorders with considerable sex differences in frequency and presentation. Moreover, genetic factors underlying disease and drug response appear to differ between male and female patients. This appears to result at least in part from different physiological effects exerted by sex hormones such that polymorphisms in susceptibility genes may have physiological relevance only in males or females. However, few examples have been discovered to play a role in complex multigenic diseases, and the mechanistic basis of genetic variants as sex-dependent susceptibility factors has yet to be explored. Therefore, pharmacogenomic studies must consider sex differences in an effort to optimize individual drug therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1208/ps050429,"Chromosomes, Human, X;Chromosomes, Human, Y;Coronary Artery Disease/drug therapy/*genetics;Depression/drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Humans;Male;*Pharmacogenetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics;Sex Characteristics;Treatment Outcome;Pharmacogenetics",15198517,PMC2750991

Continuous long-term treatment is required to maintain social functioning and prevent symptom relapse of schizophrenia patients. However, there are considerable individual differences in response to the antipsychotic drugs. There is a pressing need to identify more drug-response-related markers. But most pharmacogenomics of schizophrenia have typically focused on a few candidate genes in small sample size. In this study, 995 subjects were selected for discovering the drug-response-related markers. A total of 77 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 25 genes have been investigated for four commonly used antipsychotic drugs in China: risperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, and chlorpromazine. Significant associations with treatment response for several genes, such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, COMT, ABCB1, DRD3 and HTR2C have been verified in our study. Also, we found several new candidate genes (TNIK, RELN, NOTCH4 and SLC6A2) and combinations (haplotype rs1544325-rs5993883-rs6269-rs4818 in COMT) that are associated with treatment response to the four drugs. Also, multivariate interactions analysis demonstrated the combination of rs6269 in COMT and rs3813929 in HTR2C may work as a predictor to improve the clinical antipsychotic response. So our study is of great significance to improve current knowledge on the pharmacogenomics of schizophrenia, thus promoting the implementation of personalized medicine in schizophrenia.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 18 August 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.61.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/tpj.2015.61,"Adolescent;Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Asians/*genetics;Chi-Square Distribution;China;Chlorpromazine/*therapeutic use;Clozapine/*therapeutic use;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Haplotypes;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Odds Ratio;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Pharmacogenomic Variants/*genetics;Phenotype;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Predictive Value of Tests;Quetiapine Fumarate/*therapeutic use;Reelin Protein;Risk Factors;Risperidone/*therapeutic use;Schizophrenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/ethnology/*genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Risperidone;Genomics;Clozapine;Genome",26282453,

While a range of effective antidepressants are now available, failure and relapse rates remain substantial, with intolerable side effect burden the most commonly cited reason for discontinuation. Thus, understanding individual differences in susceptibility to antidepressant therapy side effects will be essential to optimize depression treatment. Here we perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic variation influencing susceptibility to citalopram-induced side effects. The analysis sample consisted of 1762 depression patients, successfully genotyped for 421K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR(*)D) study. Outcomes included five indicators of citalopram side effects: general side effect burden, overall tolerability, sexual side effects, dizziness and vision/hearing side effects. Two SNPs met our genome-wide significance criterion (q<0.1), ensuring that, on average, only 10% of significant findings are false discoveries. In total, 12 additional SNPs demonstrated suggestive associations (q<0.5). The top finding was rs17135437, an intronic SNP within EMID2, mediating the effects of citalopram on vision/hearing side effects (P=3.27 × 10(-8), q=0.026).

Suggestive findings were also found for SNPs at LAMA1, AOX2P, EGFLAM, FHIT and RTP2.

Identifying potential predictors of clinical response to this last-line antipsychotic could represent an important goal for treatment. Among these, functional polymorphisms involved in dopamine system modulation, known to be disrupted in schizophrenia, may play a role. We examined the COMT Val158Met polymorphism, which plays a key role in dopamine regulation at the prefrontal level, and the 5-HT1A-R -1019 C/G polymorphism, a target of clozapine activity involved in the interaction between the serotonin and dopamine systems. MATERIALS & METHODS: 107 neuroleptic-refractory, biologically unrelated Italian patients (70 males and 37 females) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who were being treated with clozapine were recruited. Psychopathology was assessed by the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) at the beginning of treatment, and at weeks 8 and 12. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood samples. COMT rs4680 (Val158Met) and 5-HT1A-R rs6295 (-1019 C/G) polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-based restriction fragment length and direct sequencing, respectively. RESULTS: We found a significant effect of COMT and 5-HT1A-R on the PANSS Negative Subscale variation, with greater improvement among COMT Val/Val and 5-HT1A-R G/G subjects. CONCLUSION: The findings support the hypothesis that COMT rs4680 and 5-HT1A-R rs6295 polymorphisms could influence the negative symptom response to clozapine, probably through modulation of the dopaminergic system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.14.150,"Adult;Biomarkers, Pharmacological;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics;Clozapine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Dopamine/metabolism;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology;Clozapine;Polymorphism, Genetic",25560469,

Past linkage studies have implicated several chromosomal regions in the etiology of schizophrenia. Within these regions, several genes have been identified via candidate gene association studies as strong schizophrenia susceptibility loci, including DAO, DAOA, DISC1, DTNBP1, and RGS4. METHODS: The present study attempted to replicate these association findings by analyzing a total of 120 markers across these genes in 311 schizophrenia subjects, 140 schizoaffective subjects, and 291 control subjects. RESULTS: Our study found no association for DAOA and DTNBP1 with schizophrenia. Although no association was seen with DAOA and DTNBP1, several other markers in the other genes resulted in significant association with schizophrenia (p < .05). However, after a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only one marker, rs3918346, within DAO remained significant (odds ratio = 1.71, confidence interval = 1.32-2.22, p = 4 x 10(-5)). This significant association was concordant with previous DAO genetic findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results significantly support DAO as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and offer some support for the implication of both RGS4 and DISC1 in the etiology of schizophrenia.

To fully evaluate SLC6A3 as a therapeutic antipshycotic target we investigated association of the gene with responses to chlorpromazine and clozapine and with chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) in the Chinese schizophrenia population. Six polymorphisms across the whole region of this gene were analyzed, namely rs2652511 (T-844C) and rs2975226 (T-71A) in the 5'-regulatory region, rs2963238 (A1491C) in intron 1, a 30-bp VNTR in intron 8, rs27072 and the 40-bp VNTR in the 3'-region.

The haplotype block constructed from the first three markers near the 5'-region showed significant association with response to clozapine (for haplotype T-T-A: p=0.0085; for haplotype C-A-C: p=0.0092). We did not identify any significant association of the six genetic variants or haplotypes with EPS after Bonferoni correction.

By design, the study analyzed only those markers that showed reproducible association in the first wave of genotypes (comprising 1,297 patients) in the complete cohort of patients. The purpose of the present study was to utilize a second wave of genotype results, for a more powerful analysis, in the complete cohort of patients with available deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples. METHOD: The authors tested the association between treatment response and 768 markers that were genotyped in the full set of 1,816 eligible patients from the STAR*D cohort. In order to control for multiple testing, the subjects were divided into two study groups: discovery and replication. RESULTS: In addition to the previously identified marker in the HTR2A gene, a new marker (rs1954787) in the GRIK4 gene, which codes for the kainic acid-type glutamate receptor KA1, was observed. The effect size of the GRIK4 marker alone was modest, but homozygote carriers of the treatment-response-associated marker alleles of both the GRIK4 and HTR2A genes were 23% less likely to experience nonresponse to treatment relative to participants who did not carry any of these marker alleles. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that genetic variation in a kainic acid-type glutamate receptor is reproducibly associated with response to the antidepressant citalopram. This finding suggests that the glutamate system plays an important role in modulating response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06111790,"Adult;African Americans/genetics;Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Base Sequence;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics;Citalopram/pharmacology/therapeutic use;Cohort Studies;Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Genetic Markers;Genotype;Humans;Male;Pharmacogenetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data;Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics;ROC Curve;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A/drug effects;Receptors, Kainic Acid/drug effects/*genetics;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Whites/genetics;Antidepressive Agents",17671280,

Outcomes included 12 indicators of metabolic side effects, quantifying antipsychotic-induced change in weight, blood lipids, glucose and hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure and heart rate. Our criterion for genomewide significance was a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. A total of 21 SNPs satisfied this criterion. The top finding indicated that a SNP in Meis homeobox 2 (MEIS2) mediated the effects of risperidone on hip circumference (q=0.004). The same SNP was also found to mediate risperidone's effect on waist circumference (q=0.055). Genomewide significant finding were also found for SNPs in PRKAR2B, GPR98, FHOD3, RNF144A, ASTN2, SOX5 and ATF7IP2, as well as in several intergenic markers. PRKAR2B and MEIS2 both have previous research indicating metabolic involvement, and PRKAR2B has previously been shown to mediate antipsychotic response.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 79 TRS and 95 non-treatment resistant (NTRS) Caucasian schizophrenia patients to identify possible biomarkers for TRS, which might also provide insight into the pathobiology of TRS. The single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2237457, located in 7p12.2, a region reported to have imprinted inheritance, was found to have the lowest p value in an allelic association test (unadjusted p = 5.53 × 10(-6)).

About 25% of Caucasians have low activity, 50% intermediate activity and 25% high activity as determined by either phenotypic or genotypic measurement. In black populations, the low activity allele (Met158; COMTL) is less frequent with about 7% being homozygous. Using a PCR based genotyping assay, we report that the Met158 allele is also less frequent in normal Han Chinese subjects with about 3% of the population being homozygous.

Furthermore, plasma levels of risperidone and its active metabolite (9-hydroxyrisperidone) at a given dose vary greatly among different individuals. For patients who metabolize risperidone slowly, a medium dose results in excessively high plasma levels, which might be related to adverse events and perhaps poor response. We thus investigated whether dose reduction to diminish adverse reactions associated with ordinary risperidone doses could still yield efficacy for acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. METHOD: Thirty-one newly hospitalized Chinese patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (DSM-IV) entered this prospective, 6-week open trial. Risperidone doses were titrated to 6 mg/day (if tolerable) over 3 days, but were lowered thereafter if side effects appeared. Efficacy and side effect assessments were conducted on days 0, 4, 14, 28, and 42. Endpoint steady-state plasma levels of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. RESULTS: Thirty patients completed the trial. Of them, 17 tolerated the 6-mg target dose well, while the other 13 received lower final doses (mean +/- SD = 3.6 +/- 0.9 mg, p = .0001) for curtailing treatment-emergent side effects. At endpoint, 92.3% of the 13 low-dose individuals responded to treatment (20% or more reduction in the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score), compared with 52.9% of the 17 high-dose subjects (p < .05). No significant between-group differences were revealed in other minor efficacy measures. Of note, endpoint plasma levels of the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) were similar between the low- and high-dose groups (40.4 +/- 31.1 ng/mL vs. 49.7 +/- 13.4 ng/mL, NS). CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary trial suggest that up to 6 mg of risperidone is efficacious in treating patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Nearly 60% of the patients could tolerate a 6-mg dose. For the other 40%, reducing dosages to 3.6 +/- 0.9 mg for relieving side effects still yielded efficacy.

The biological basis of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation is unknown. Genetic markers may shed light on the causes of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and help identify individuals at high risk who may benefit from closer monitoring, alternative treatments, or specialty care. METHOD: A clinically representative cohort of outpatients with major depressive disorder who enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial were treated with citalopram under a standard protocol for up to 14 weeks. DNA samples from 1,915 participants were genotyped for 768 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 68 candidate genes. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between the 120 participants who developed treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and those who did not. RESULTS: Two markers were significantly associated with treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in this sample (marker rs4825476, p=0.0000784, odds ratio=1.94; permutation p=0.01; marker rs2518224, p=0.0000243, odds ratio=8.23; permutation p=0.003).

One hundred and eighty patients were genotyped for the COMT Val(108/158)Met, rs4680 genetic polymorphism and classified into three genotype subgroups: Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met. The COMT genotype was the explanatory variable, and the variables to be explained were HDRS score, HDRS score improvement over time, response rate and remission rate. Venlafaxine had a trend to higher efficacy in the Val/Val patients as compared to Met/Met carriers, as shown by the HDRS score improvement after 3 months of treatment, but this result was not significant in mixed models [Val/Val: 59.78% (±22.4); Val/Met: 51.64% (±26.3); Met/Met: 39.52% (±27.6)].

For this reason, it is both misleading and unhelpful to perpetuate the current practice of reporting association results for these trials one gene at a time, ignoring the fact that multiple gene-by-phenotype tests are being carried out on the same data set. On the other hand, suggestive associations in such trials may lead to new hypotheses that can be tested through both replication efforts and biological experimentation. The appropriate handling of these forms of data therefore requires dissemination of association statistics without undue emphasis on select findings. Here we attempt to illustrate this approach by presenting association statistics for 2769 polymorphisms in 118 candidate genes evaluated for 21 pharmacogenetic phenotypes.

Individuals homozygous for the TT-genotype at one of the markers (rs1360780) reported more depressive episodes and responded better to antidepressant treatment. There was no association between markers in FKBP5 and disease. The present study aimed at studying the associated FKBP5 markers in the ethnically diverse Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) sample of non-hospitalized patients treated with citalopram. METHODS: We used clinical data and DNA samples from 1809 outpatients with non-psychotic major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria), who received up to 14 weeks of citalopram. A subset of 1523 patients of White non-Hispanic or Black race was matched with 739 control subjects for a case-control analysis. The markers rs1360780 and rs4713916 were genotyped on the Illumina platform. TaqMan-assay was used for marker rs3800373. RESULTS: In the case-control analysis, marker rs1360780 was significantly associated with disease status in the White non-Hispanic sample after correction for multiple testing. A significant association was also found between rs4713916 and remission. Markers rs1360780 and rs4713916 were in strong linkage disequilibrium in the White non-Hispanic but not in the Black population.

Current studies have found associations of SLC6A4 polymorphisms with several psychiatric traits including bipolar affective disorder (BPD) in various populations; however, studies with contradictory results were also reported. This study examined the role of SLC6A4 in etiology of BPD in a Taiwanese population. METHODS: Ten markers including two variable number tandem repeat and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the SLC6A4 gene were used to study the genetic association with 90 unrelated BPD, type I patients and 103 controls. RESULTS: Two SNPs were not informative in a Taiwanese population and the other eight polymorphic markers were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and haplotype analysis. No association was detected for any single SLC6A4 marker and BPD. Additional statistic analyses including other factors also showed lack of association between the SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms and BPD. Significant linkage disequilibrium was obtained among eight SLC6A4 markers and eight common haplotypes were constructed that can be found in 95% of the total subjects. The four commonest haplotypes in both patients and controls were identical. However, the fifth commonest haplotype differed in patients and controls and was significantly associated with a protection from BPD. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that a particular SLC6A4 haplotype harboring functional sequence variant could play a significant role in BPD etiology in Taiwan. However, due to its modest sample size, the conclusion is not final and should be confirmed in the future studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1097/00008571-200403000-00005,"Bipolar Disorder/epidemiology/*etiology;Carrier Proteins/*genetics;Case-Control Studies;Genotype;Haplotypes/*genetics;Humans;Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics;*Membrane Transport Proteins;Minisatellite Repeats/*genetics;Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Serotonin/metabolism;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins;Taiwan/epidemiology;Mood Disorders;Haplotypes;Taiwan",15167705,

So, we attempted to evaluate the association between dopamine D2 (DRD2) receptor, serotonergic (5HT2A) receptor and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms and response to treatment with risperidone in persons with schizophrenia from North India. It was a multicentric 12-weeks prospective study, undertaken in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to International Classification of Diseases 10th revision, Diagnostic Criteria for Research module (ICD-10 DCR). Patients were treated with incremental dosages of risperidone. Nine gene polymorphisms from three genes viz. DRD2, 5-HT2A and CYP2D6 along with socio-demographical and clinical variables were analyzed to ascertain the association in response to risperidone treatment.

Improving lithium dose prediction using population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics: a cohort genome-wide association study in Sweden.,2022,6,,The lancet.

The therapeutic range of lithium, however, is narrow and treatment initiation requires individual titration to address inter-individual variability. We aimed to improve lithium dose prediction using clinical and genomic data. METHODS: We performed a population pharmacokinetic study followed by a genome-wide association study (GWAS), including two clinical Swedish cohorts. Participants in cohort 1 were from specialised outpatient clinics at Huddinge Hospital, in Stockholm, Sweden, and participants in cohort 2 were identified using the Swedish National Quality Registry for Bipolar disorder (BipoläR). Patients who received a lithium dose corresponding to at least one tablet of lithium sulphate (6 mmol) per day and had clinically relevant plasma concentrations of lithium were included in the study. Data on age, sex, bodyweight, height, creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lithium preparation, number of tablets of lithium per day, serum lithium concentration, and medications affecting kidney function (C09 antihypertensives, C03 [except C03D] sodium-retaining diuretics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were obtained retrospectively for several timepoints when possible from electronic health records, BipoläR, and the Swedish prescription registry. The median time between timepoints was 1·07 years for cohort 1 and 1·09 years for cohort 2. The primary outcome of interest was the natural logarithm of total body clearance for lithium (CL(Li)) associated with the clinical variables. The residual effects after accounting for age and sex, representing the individual-level effects (CL(Li,age/sex)), were used as the dependent variable in a GWAS. FINDINGS: 2357 patients who were administered lithium (1423 women [60·4%] and 934 men [39·6%]; mean age 53·6 years [range 17-89], mainly of European descent) were included and 5627 data points were obtained. Age (variance explained [R(2)]: R(2)(cohort1)=0·41 and R(2)(cohort2)=0·31; both p<0·0001), sex (R(2)(cohort1)=0·0063 [p=0·045] and R(2)(cohort2)=0·026 [p<0·0001]), eGFR (R(2)(cohort1)=0·38 and R(2)(cohort2)=0·20; both p<0·0001), comedication with diuretics (R(2)(cohort1)=0·0058 [p=0·014] and R(2)(cohort2)=0·0026 [p<0·0001]), and agents acting on the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (R(2)(cohort1)=0·028 and R(2)(cohort2)=0·015; both p<0·0001) were clinical predictors of CL(Li). Notably, an association between CL(Li) and serum lithium was observed, with a lower CL(Li) being associated with higher serum lithium (R(2)(cohort1)=0·13 and R(2)(cohort2)=0·15; both p<0·0001). In a GWAS of CL(Li,age/sex), one locus was associated with a change in CL(Li) (rs583503; β=-0·053 [95% CI -0·071 to -0·034]; p<0·00000005). We also found enrichment of the associations with genes expressed in the medulla (p=0·0014, corrected FDR=0·04) and cortex of the kidney (p=0·0015, corrected FDR=0·04), as well as associations with polygenic risk scores for eGFR (p value threshold: 0·05, p=0·01), body-mass index (p value threshold: 0·05, p=0·00025), and blood urea nitrogen (p value threshold: 0·001, p=0·00043). The model based on six clinical predictors explained 61·4% of the variance in CL(Li) in cohort 1 and 49·8% in cohort 2. Adding genetic markers did not lead to major improvement of the models: within the subsample of genotyped individuals, the variance explained only increased from 59·32% to 59·36% in cohort 1 and from 49·21% to 50·03% in cohort 2 when including rs583503 and the four first principal components. INTERPRETATION: Our model predictors could be used clinically to better guide lithium dosage, shortening the time to reach therapeutic concentrations, thus improving care. Identification of the first genomic locus and PRS to be associated with CL(Li) introduces the opportunity of individualised medicine in lithium treatment.

Here, we show that the administration of 300 mg of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA to 200 healthy male subjects influences learning about a partners' prosocial preferences in a novel social interaction task, which is akin to a repeated trust game. We found learning to be modulated by a well-established genetic marker of striatal dopamine levels, the 40-bp variable number tandem repeats polymorphism of the dopamine transporter (DAT1 polymorphism). In particular, we found that L-DOPA improves learning in 10/10R genoype subjects, who are assumed to have lower endogenous striatal dopamine levels and impairs learning in 9/10R genotype subjects, who are assumed to have higher endogenous dopamine levels. These findings provide first evidence for a critical role of dopamine in learning whether an interaction partner has a prosocial or a selfish personality. The applied pharmacogenetic approach may open doors to new ways of studying psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, which is characterized by distorted perceptions of others' prosocial attitudes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1371/journal.pone.0067820,"Alleles;Biomarkers/metabolism;Corpus Striatum/drug effects/metabolism;Dopamine/metabolism;Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism;Gene Expression;Gene Frequency;Genotyping Techniques;Humans;Levodopa/*pharmacology;Male;Personality/*genetics;*Polymorphism, Genetic;*Social Conformity;Young Adult;Polymorphism, Genetic;Levodopa;Dihydroxyphenylalanine",23861813,PMC3701618
Complement 3 and metabolic syndrome induced by clozapine: a cross-sectional study and retrospective cohort analysis.,2017,1,,The pharmacogenomics journal,1473-1150 (Electronic),17,1,92-97,Zhang C and Zhang Y and Cai J and Chen M and Song L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26503818/,eng,,United States,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is considered to be an adverse effect of long-term treatment with atypical antipsychotics, particularly clozapine. There is strong evidence that the activation of inflammatory pathways interferes with normal metabolism and contributes to the development of MetS. C3, which is an inflammation molecule, has been reported to be associated with MetS. Because C3 is a heritable trait, we accordingly hypothesized that the gene encoding C3 (C3) would be a candidate gene for inter-individual variation in clozapine-induced MetS. We recruited 576 schizophrenia patients taking clozapine and measured the serum levels of fasting metabolic parameters. We then examined C3 mRNA and genotyped seven polymorphisms in C3. The expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data available for tissues were extracted by the Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal. A total of 105 patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain the metabolic parameters during the initial 2-year clozapine treatment. The relative expression levels of C3 mRNA in patients with MetS were significantly higher than in those without MetS (P=0.02). C3 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2277984 was marginally associated with MetS (allelic P=0.06, odds ratio=1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.72). We found a significant association of rs2277984 with fasting triglyceride (TG) levels (P=0.004). Further, eQTL analysis revealed that rs2277984 regulates C3 expression in the liver (P=0.002). Similar results were found in the retrospective cohort analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a significant effect of the rs2277984 G allele on the percentage change of TG levels, with an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60-0.81). C3 is likely to enhance TG accumulation and to confer susceptibility to clozapine-induced MetS. The C3 SNP rs2277984 may be a potential biomarker for predicting MetS risk in patients receiving clozapine treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/tpj.2015.68,"Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Area Under Curve;Clozapine/*adverse effects;Complement C3/*genetics/metabolism;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Liver/metabolism;Male;Metabolic Syndrome/blood/chemically induced/*genetics/immunology;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;*Pharmacogenomic Variants;Phenotype;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Quantitative Trait Loci;ROC Curve;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy;Treatment Outcome;Triglycerides/blood;Cohort Studies;Cesarean Section;Clozapine;Complement System Proteins",26503818,

The entire CYP2D6 gene locus was sequenced in 15 Xhosa control individuals and the data generated were used to design a comprehensive genotyping strategy. Over 25 CYP2D6 alleles were genotyped in Xhosa controls and Xhosa schizophrenia patients using long-range PCR, DNA sequencing and single nucleotide primer extension analysis. Bioinformatic algorithms were used to predict the functional consequences of relevant mutations and samples were assigned CYP2D6 activity scores. A unique allele distribution was revealed and two rare novel alleles, CYP2D6*73 and CYP2D6*74, were identified. No significant differences in allele frequencies were detected between Xhosa controls and schizophrenia patients.

The subjects included 51 chronic schizophrenic patients whose symptoms were not controlled with chronic conventional antipsychotics and therefore were switched to olanzapine. Male smokers had a significantly lower olanzapine concentration-dose ratio and olanzapine/4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine ratio (which reflects CYP1A2 activity) than male nonsmokers and female nonsmokers. The results of a 2-way analysis of covariance showed that smoking had the main effect, rather than gender or age. The functional gene polymorphisms that were studied had no effect on the plasma olanzapine and metabolite concentrations. An improved total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was not correlated with the plasma olanzapine concentration, but individual BPRS scores related to improvement of suspiciousness, hallucinations, and blunted affect were significantly correlated with plasma olanzapine concentration. Clinical factors, especially smoking, were more important modulators of olanzapine metabolism than the functional genotypes.

Interindividual heterogeneity in AIP development and severity is associated with risk factors such as antipsychotic drug type, old age, and female gender. There is evidence for genetic predisposition to develop AIP but the variants that confer susceptibility or protection are mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify genes related to AIP susceptibility, we performed a pharmacogenomic genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AIP severity. METHODS: Three hundred ninety-seven American schizophrenia patients who participated in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE)-GWAS project were included in our analysis. Patients had been randomized to treatment with antipsychotic monotherapy for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 18 months during phase 1 of the CATIE trial. They were regularly assessed for AIP severity using the modified Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). For statistical analysis, patients were dichotomized as cases (average SAS mean global score > 0.3 during CATIE phase 1, N = 199) or controls (average SAS mean global score 0, N = 198). RESULTS: Using logistic regression and controlling for population stratification, age, gender, SAS score at baseline, and concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs, we identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with AIP severity. Although none reached the GWAS significance level of P < 4.2 x 10(-7), some promising candidate genes for further research on genetic predisposition to AIP were identified including EPF1, NOVA1, and FIGN.

We aimed to demonstrate how this type of analysis can be used in medical decision making to assess whether psychiatrists were influenced in their treatment recommendations by information on the genotype of a patient, despite knowing the patient's response to treatment as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A patient's genetic information may be used to predict their response to therapy; such information, however, becomes redundant, and should not influence decisions, once a clinician knows the patient's actual response to treatment. METHODS: Sixty-seven psychiatrists were presented with patients' pre- or post-treatment scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for two hypothetical treatments for schizophrenia. Psychiatrists were also informed whether the patient possessed a genotype linked to hyper-responsiveness to one of the treatments, and were asked to recommend one of these two treatments. Attribute nonattendance assessed whether the information on genotype influenced psychiatrists' treatment recommendations. RESULTS: Years of experience predicted whether psychiatrists were influenced by the genetic information. Psychiatrists with 1 year or less of experience had a 46% probability of considering genetic information, whereas psychiatrists with at least 15 years of experience had a lower probability (7%).

More information on the pharmacogenetics of this receptor may therefore be useful in developing individualized therapy. However, to our knowledge, no study has been reported in this area. The aim of this investigation was to clarify whether H3 receptor polymorphism could affect risperidone efficacy. We genotyped tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the HRH3 gene (rs3787429 and rs3787430) and analyzed their association with the reduction of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score in Chinese Han schizophrenia patients (N = 129), following an eight-week period of risperidone monotherapy. The confounding effects of non-genetic factors were estimated, and then the significant one was included as the covariate for adjustment in statistical analysis. Baseline symptom score was the only significant confounding effect and thus the covariate. After adjustment, significant association of HRH3 with antipsychotic efficacy was detected (for rs3787429, p = 0.013, 0.087 after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment, respectively; for rs3787430, p = 0.024, 0.010 after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment, respectively) and stood up to conservative Bonferroni correction. Our results demonstrate that polymorphism of the HRH3 gene may be a potential genetic marker for predicting the therapeutic effect of risperidone, and suggest novel pharmacological links between HRH3 and risperidone. Further studies with larger samples and different ethnic populations are warranted to confirm our results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0269881111405358,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Asians/genetics;Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Pharmacogenetics/methods;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptors, Histamine H3/*genetics;Risperidone/*therapeutic use;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics",21652606,

We tested the possible association of 24 polymorphisms from six dopaminergic genes: namely, dopamine receptors D1, D2, D3, D4; the dopamine transporter (DAT); and the catalyzing enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), with TD. METHODS: Multiple SNP/VNTR markers from candidate genes were analyzed using suitable approaches and allelic, genotypic and haplotypic associations were tested. RESULTS: 120 bp duplication marker, 1.2 kb upstream from initiation codon of DRD4 gene showed a significant genotypic association [chi2 = 9.29, P = 0.009; OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.31-0.86) for genotype 120 dup/120 dup].

Schizophrenic symptoms were allocated into 5 clusters: positive, excitement, cognitive, negative, and anxiety-depression symptoms. Patients were C/C in 12, C/T in 12 and T/T in 7 cases for C3435T genotype and G/G in 3, G/T or A in 17 and T or A/T or A in 11 cases for G2677T/A genotype. There were a tendency of difference, but not statistically different, in the percentage improvement or the improved scores of 5 sub-grouped symptoms after the 3-week treatment between C3435T genotypes and between G2677T/A genotypes. Multiple regression analyses including age, body weight, gender and drug concentration showed significant correlations between the percentage improvement and the improved scores of cognitive symptoms and C3435T genotypes.

P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) is known to regulate the concentration of antipsychotic drugs in the brain. Variable expressivity based on polymorphism in the gene ABCB1 may reflect on the drug response and its relationship to dosage. MATERIALS & METHODS: All antipsychotic dosages administered to patients were converted to common chlorpromazine equivalents. Response to antipsychotics was based on 50% cutoff in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ratings after 1-year of follow-up. Using a case-control study design, ABCB1 polymorphisms were screened in 192 individuals grouped into responders and nonresponders. RESULTS: A strong allelic, genotypic and haplotypic association, was observed, which was predictive of good response to antipsychotics. Individuals carrying the favorable homozygous genotypes of rs1045642 and rs2032582 displayed better response with increased dosage while those carrying risk genotype manifested refractoriness on increased dosage.

The lithium-blockable enzyme inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase in the phospholipase C signaling pathway is a putative target for the mood-stabilizing effects of lithium. In the present study, we searched for DNA variations in the human INPP1 gene encoding the inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase enzyme. We report the existence of four common polymorphisms in the coding region of the gene. The DNA alterations were all single base substitutions, of which one (A682G) predicted an amino acid change (Thr228Ala), whereas the remaining three (G153T, G348A and C973A) were silent, In a Norwegian pilot sample the frequencies of the four single base substitutions were not significantly different between lithium-treated bipolar patients and healthy control individuals. When subdivided with respect to drug response, however, the C973A transversion was present in six out of nine lithium responders (67%) versus one out of nine non-responders (11%) In contrast, the C973A polymorphism was equally common among lithium responders and non-responders in an independent sample of bipolar patients from Israel.

Gene expression levels were determined in 64 individuals from 18 families, while prescription medication information has been collected over a 10-year period for 931 affected individuals. We demonstrate that the NDE1 SNP rs2242549 associates with significant changes in gene expression for 2908 probes (2542 genes), of which 794 probes (719 genes) were replicable.

BDNF gene is a genetic risk factor for schizophrenia and is related to the chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in the Chinese population.,2008,6,,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,1744-6872 (Print),18,6,449-57,Xu MQ and St Clair D and Feng GY and Lin ZG and He G and Li X and He L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408624/,eng,,United States,"BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to a family of the neurotrophin, which plays important roles in the neurodevelopment of dopaminergic-related systems and interacts with meso-limbic dopaminergic systems involved in the therapeutic response to antipsychotics. Functional experiments have suggested that BDNF may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we genotyped two important functional polymorphisms in the BDNF gene using a sample of Han Chinese patients consisting of 340 schizophrenic patients and 343 healthy controls. We found a statistical difference in the 232-bp allele distribution of the BDNF gene (GT)n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism between the schizophrenic patients and controls. In early onset patients, the 234-bp allele had a risk role. For the chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome, the 230-bp allele and the 234-bp allele acted in opposite directions, that is, patients with the 230-bp allele of the (GT)n polymorphism exhibited a lower degree of induced extrapyramidal syndrome. Haplotype-based analysis also revealed a very important risk haplotype (P=0.0000226546).

Similarly, functional variation in the genes encoding these receptors is also associated with these phenotypes. In particular, the DRD2 rs1076560 T allele predicts a lower ratio of expression of D2 short/long isoforms, suboptimal working memory processing, and better response to antipsychotic treatment compared with the G allele. Furthermore, the HTR2A T allele is associated with lower 5-HT2A expression, impaired working memory processing, and poorer response to antipsychotics compared with the C allele. Here, we investigated in healthy subjects whether these functional polymorphisms have a combined effect on prefrontal cortical physiology and related cognitive behavior linked to schizophrenia as well as on response to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia. In a total sample of 620 healthy subjects, we found that subjects with the rs1076560 T and rs6314 T alleles have greater fMRI prefrontal activity during working memory. Similar results were obtained within the attentional domain. Also, the concomitant presence of the rs1076560 T/rs6314 T alleles also predicted lower behavioral accuracy during working memory. Moreover, we found that rs1076560 T carrier/rs6314 CC individuals had better responses to antipsychotic treatment in two independent samples of patients with schizophrenia (n=63 and n=54, respectively), consistent with the previously reported separate effects of these genotypes. These results indicate that DRD2 and HTR2A genetic variants together modulate physiological prefrontal efficiency during working memory and also modulate the response to antipsychotics.

In human brain, the NO could be generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3). In this study, we studied whether the genetic variants in human NOS3 gene is associated with TD in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-two chronic inpatients with schizophrenia treated with typical antipsychotics were recruited in this study. The patients were further grouped by the presence of TD or not according to the Research and Diagnostic Criteria for TD. The genetic variants in the NOS3 gene investigated in this study were -786T > C in the promotor region, 27-bp variable number of tandem repeats (27-bp VNTR) in intron 4, and Glu298Asp in exon 7. The frequencies of genotypes, alleles and haplotypes of the three markers were compared between the TD (n = 153) and non-TD (n = 129) groups. RESULTS: There were no significant associations between the genotypes and alleles of the three markers and TD. However, in the haplotype-based case-control analysis, the frequency of haplotype T-4b-Glu was significantly higher in non-TD than in TD group (TD vs. non-TD = 72.7% vs. 81.0%, permutation P value = 0.021, OR = 0.648, 95% CI = 0.432-0.973). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the haplotype T-4b-Glu represents a protective haplotype against TD after long-term antipsychotic treatment.

Data about recurrence rate of mood episodes were collected for at least 2 years before lithium and 2 years on lithium. Results showed that homozygotes for the wild variant did not change their recurrence index while carriers of the mutant allele improved, thus supporting the hypothesis that GSK is a target for the therapeutic action of lithium. Results warrant interest for the variants of genes pertaining to the molecular clock as possible endophenotypes of bipolar disorder, but caution ought to be taken in interpreting these preliminary results and future replication studies must be awaited because of the low frequency of the GSK3-beta*C/C genotype in the studied populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.neulet.2004.11.022,"Adult;Analysis of Variance;Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/*genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;Female;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*genetics;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta;Humans;Lithium/therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Promoter Regions, Genetic;RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods;Time;Time Factors",15694273,

CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests a negative effect of the IL1B gene on pharmacological response and amygdala and ACC function involving the same genotypes of two SNPs (rs16944, rs116343), which taken together increase the risk of nonremission over 6 weeks of antidepressant treatment in MDD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.11.004,"Adult;Aged;Amygdala/blood supply/physiology;Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Confidence Intervals;Deep Brain Stimulation/methods;Depressive Disorder, Major/*complications;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Genotype;Gyrus Cinguli/blood supply/physiology;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Interleukin-1beta/*genetics;Logistic Models;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Oxygen/blood;Pharmacogenetics;Photic Stimulation/methods;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Stress, Psychological/*etiology/*genetics/pathology/therapy",20044070,

Increased antipsychotic penetration to the primary site of activity may result in greater symptom improvement or the occurrence of side effects. This investigation examined the relationship between three common PGP polymorphisms (C1236T, G2677TA, and C3435T) and response to 6 weeks of open-label olanzapine treatment in patients with schizophrenia. Individuals with a PGP T allele at any of these polymorphisms would be expected to have greater antipsychotic penetration through the blood brain barrier, due to lower PGP activity. Forty-one patients were included in this reanalysis. For subjects in the 3435T allele carrier group, the plasma olanzapine level alone was positively associated with percent change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score (p = 0.02). This relationship was not seen for the 3435CC group (p = 0.583). A similar trend was observed for negative symptom reduction, olanzapine plasma concentration, and the 3435T allele (p = 0.06), but this relationship did not meet statistical significance. There was no relationship between the PGP genotypes and changes in weight over the course of this 6 week study. The analysis using C1236T or G2677AT genotypes gave similar results, due to linkage of these polymorphisms.PGP polymorphisms may affect the penetration of olanzapine into the central nervous system as seen by a relationship between the 3435T allele, olanzapine plasma levels, and reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This may stem from greater olanzapine central nervous system latency due to the presence of the 3435T allele and reduced PGP activity. The PGP C3435T genotype may help to determine positive symptom reduction from olanzapine clinically, but these findings should be replicated in a larger sample of subjects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/01.ftd.0000246761.82377.a6,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics;Adolescent;Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use;Benzodiazepines/blood/therapeutic use;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Olanzapine;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Schizophrenia/blood/*drug therapy;Weight Gain/genetics;Glycoproteins;Schizophrenia;P-Glycoproteins;P-Glycoprotein",17038883,

Among mood-stabilizing treatments, lithium represents the mainstay in the therapeutic management of BD. However, besides the relatively high rate of excellent responders, a significant fraction of patients present patterns of partial or nonresponse to lithium. This variability might be influenced by genetic factors, even though findings have so far been inconclusive. Here, we present the results of an exploratory genome-wide scan followed by extended genotyping carried out on a sample of 204 Sardinian BD patients characterized for lithium response. MATERIALS & METHODS: Phenotypic assessment of lithium response was made using the retrospective criteria of long-term treatment response scale. Using Affymetrix(®) 6.0 SNP arrays, we genotyped a subsample of 52 BD patients evenly distributed at the extreme ends of the treatment response scale. The associated SNPs were then prioritized and selected for validation and extended genotyping in the whole sample of BD patients characterized for lithium response. Association was also tested using the scale for a quantitative trait analysis. RESULTS: Our findings showed that several SNPs were nominally associated (p ≤ 10(-5)) with lithium response in the subgroup of 52 BD subjects. Some association signals were then confirmed in the extended sample. The strongest association, also supported by the quantitative trait analysis, was shown for a SNP located in intron 1 of the ACCN1 gene, encoding for a cation channel with high affinity for sodium and permeable to lithium. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ACCN1 gene is a potential candidate for response to lithium treatment that would serve as a genetic marker of lithium efficacy for BD patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.11.102,"Acid Sensing Ion Channels;Adult;Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use;*Biomarkers, Pharmacological;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy;Degenerin Sodium Channels;Epithelial Sodium Channels/*genetics;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Italy;Lithium Compounds/*therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Quantitative Trait, Heritable;Bipolar Disorder",21961650,

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the -1438A/G polymorphism of the 5-HTR2A gene and the response to mirtazapine in a Korean population with major depressive disorder. Mirtazapine was administered for eight weeks to the 101 patients who completed the study, during which we evaluated the clinical outcome using repeated-measures ANCOVA. A main effect of genotype or an effect of genotype-time interactions on the decrease in HAMD score during the eight-week follow-up was not found, which suggests that the 5-HTR2A -1438A/G polymorphism does not affect the clinical outcome to mirtazapine administration. However, significant effects of genotype and allele carriers on the decrease in the sleep score over the eight weeks were found (genotype: F = 4.093, p = 0.017; allele: F = 4.371, p = 0.037), whereas no effect of genotype-time interactions on the decrease in the HAMD score over the eight-week follow-up was found. These observations suggest that the -1438A/G polymorphism on the sleep improvement at each time period revealed significant differences in the sleep scores after two weeks of mirtazapine administration. The sleep scores were lower for carriers of the A+ allele than of the A- allele after two weeks of mirtazapine administration (p = 0.041), which means that the -1438GG genotype is associated with less improvement in sleep, and suggests that the effect of mirtazapine on improving the sleep quality differs with the 5-HTR2A -1438A/G polymorphism within two weeks of mirtazapine treatment. In conclusion, although the -1438A/G polymorphism affects the sleep improvement resulting from the administration of mirtazapine to Korean patients with major depressive disorder, our results do not support the hypothesis that this polymorphism of the 5-HTR2A gene is involved in the therapeutic response to mirtazapine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2190/PM.37.3.h,"Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use;Asians/genetics/statistics & numerical data;Case-Control Studies;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/ethnology/metabolism;Female;Genotype;Heterozygote;Humans;Male;Mianserin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Middle Aged;Mirtazapine;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A/genetics/metabolism;Receptors, Serotonin/*genetics/metabolism;Sleep/drug effects/genetics;Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/chemically induced/genetics/psychology;Treatment Outcome;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A;Serotonin Agents;Receptors, Serotonin;Polymorphism, Genetic",18314859,

Two recent studies in the same cohort of Chinese Han subjects have shown that polymorphisms of the promoter regions of both the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT2C) receptor and the leptin genes, are associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain over 10 weeks. We have investigated whether these effects remain true in a Caucasian population and following longer term treatment. METHODS: Seventy-three Spanish caucasian patients with a first-episode psychosis and initially drug-naive were genotyped for the 5-HT2C receptor -759C/T and leptin -2548A/G polymorphisms. Body mass index and plasma leptin levels were monitored after 6 weeks, 3 months and 9 months of antipsychotic treatment. RESULTS: Patients with the -759T variant allele showed significantly less weight gain than those without this allele. This effect held true in the smaller group of patients receiving olanzapine. The -2548 leptin polymorphism was not associated with short-term (6 week and 3 month) weight increases but did show significant association with 9-month antipsychotic-induced weight gain. The 5-HT2C -759 genotype was significantly associated with pre-treatment plasma leptin levels.

Recent research has suggested that BDNF may be implicated in the etiology of mood disorders and schizophrenia, as well as in the therapeutic action of some drugs, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics. This study aimed to develop a simple, fast and accurate new method for detecting the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene in schizophrenia patients using melting-curve analysis and a DNA-specific dye, SYBR Green I. A group of 30 schizophrenia patients were analyzed to detect the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) using the new genotyping method based on the analysis of fluorescence melting curves of PCR products that were labeled with SYBR Green I. The genotype results were confirmed for all 30 samples using the specific BDNF TaqMan allele discrimination assay. This new method allows the analysis of both alleles in the same reaction tube using SYBR Green I, with no need for additional steps. The addition of a GC clamp makes this method universally applicable, since the melting temperature of one allele can be adjusted as necessary to give the distinctive separation of melting curves.

The present study aimed to train and validate artificial neural networks (ANN), using clinical and pharmacogenetic data, to predict clozapine response in schizophrenic patients. Five pharmacogenetic variables and five clinical variables were collated from 93 schizophrenic patients taking clozapine, including 26 responders. ANN analysis was carried out by training the network with data from 75% of cases and subsequently testing with data from 25% of unseen cases to determine the optimal ANN architecture. Then the leave-one-out method was used to examine the generalization of the models. The optimal ANN architecture was found to be a standard feed-forward, fully-connected, back-propagation multilayer perceptron. The overall accuracy rate of ANN was 83.3%, which is higher than that of logistic regression (LR) (70.8%). By using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve as a measure of performance, the ANN outperformed the LR (0.821+/-0.054 versus 0.579+/-0.068; p<0.001). The ANN with only genetic variables outperformed the ANN with only clinical variables (0.805+/-0.056 versus 0.647+/-0.066; p=0.046).

A microsatellite repeat in the promoter of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A subunit (GRIN2A) gene suppresses transcriptional activity and correlates with chronic outcome in schizophrenia.,2003,5,,Pharmacogenetics,0960-314X (Print),13,5,271-8,Itokawa M and Yamada K and Yoshitsugu K and Toyota T and Suga T and Ohba H and Watanabe A and Hattori E and Shimizu H and Kumakura T and Ebihara M and Meerabux JM and Toru M and Yoshikawa T,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12724619/,eng,,England,"Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, based on the observation that non-competitive antagonists of the NMDA receptor, such as phencyclidine, induce schizophrenia-like symptoms. Mice lacking the NR2A subunit of the NMDA receptor complex are known to display abnormal behaviour, similar to schizophrenic symptoms. The expression of NR2A starts at puberty, a period corresponding to the clinical onset of schizophrenia. This evidence suggests that the NR2A (GRIN2A) gene may play a role in the development of schizophrenia and disease phenotypes. In this study, we performed a genetic analysis of this gene in schizophrenia. Analysis of the GRIN2A gene detected four single nucleotide polymorphisms, and a variable (GT)(n) repeat in the promoter region of the gene. A case-control study (375 schizophrenics and 378 controls) demonstrated evidence of an association between the repeat polymorphism and the disease (P = 0.05, Mann-Whitney test), with longer alleles overly represented in patients. An in-vitro promoter assay revealed a length dependent inhibition of transcriptional activity by the (GT)(n) repeat, which was consistent with a receptor binding assay in postmortem brains. Significantly, the score of symptom severity in chronic patients correlated with repeat size (P = 0.01, Spearman's Rank test). These results illustrate a genotype-phenotype correlation in schizophrenia and suggest that the longer (GT)(n) stretch may act as a risk-conferring factor that worsens chronic outcome by reducing GRIN2A levels in the brain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1097/00008571-200305000-00006,"Adult;Aged;Base Sequence;DNA Primers;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Female;Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics;Humans;Male;Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Prognosis;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*genetics;Reference Values;Schizophrenia/*genetics;Transcription, Genetic/*genetics;Treatment Outcome;Schizophrenia;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate;Microsatellite Repeats",12724619,

Recent treatment attempts before clinic admission included venlafaxine and fluoxetine. Venlafaxine was discontinued due to lack of response, and subsequently switched to fluoxetine based on pharmacogenotyping of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp, encoded by ABCB1) by the outpatient psychiatrist. Despite steady state serum levels within the therapeutic range, the patient did not benefit from fluoxetine either, necessitating admission to our clinic. Here a clinical pharmacist-led medication review including additional pharmacogenetic (PGx) analysis resulted in the change of the antidepressant therapy to bupropion. Under the new regimen, established in the in-patient-setting, the patient remitted. However, based on the assessed pharmacokinetics-related gene variants, including CYPs and ABCB1, non-response to fluoxetine could not be conclusively explained. Therefore, we retrospectively selected the serotonin transporter (SERT1, encoded by SLC6A4) for further genetic analysis of pharmacodynamic variability. The patient presented to be a homozygous carrier of the short allele variant in the 5-HTTLPR (S/S) located within the SLC6A4 promoter region, which has been associated with a reduced expression of the SERT1.

METHODS: 49 patients with major depression and SSRI treatment were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR locus including the rs25531. Drug serum concentrations and depression severity were measured weekly. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between 5-HTTLPR, SSRI serum concentrations and response to treatment. A favourable treatment outcome correlated with SSRI serum concentration in 5-HTTLPR-L(A) allele carriers (r² = 34.3 %; p = 0.001), but not in S/L(G)-allele carriers (p = 0.31). DISCUSSION: In the group of L(A) allele carriers, those MDD patients with a high antidepressant serum concentrations responded better to treatment than patients with a low serum concentration.

Ginkgo biloba (EGb-761) is a potent antioxidant that has neuroprotective effects mediated through enhancing BDNF levels. We hypothesized that treatment with EGb-761 would increase serum BDNF levels and reduce TD, particularly among schizophrenia patients who have the BDNF valine 66 to methionine (Val66Met) genotype (Val/Val). METHODS: Serum BDNF levels and genotyping for the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism were assessed in Chinese schizophrenic patients with (n = 368) and without (n = 563) TD as well as healthy control subjects (n = 546). About half of the TD patients (n = 157) then participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-control 12-week treatment with 240 mg per day of EGb-761. Serum BDNF levels were measured again at posttreatment. Clinical efficacy was determined using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). RESULTS: TD patients had lower BDNF levels than the non-TD patients and healthy controls. EGb-761 treatment improved symptoms of TD and increased BDNF levels compared with placebo treatment. Moreover, the improvement of AIMS total score correlated with the increase in BDNF levels. Furthermore, improvement in the AIMS score was greatest in those with the Val/Val allele and lowest with the Met/Met allele. CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF system may be implicated in the pathophysiology of TD and its improvement with antioxidant treatment.

We resequenced the human SLC6A1 gene previously and discovered a novel 21 bp insertion in the predicted promoter region that creates a second tandem copy of the sequence. Here we sought to determine the functional relevance of this variation. METHODS: We used reporter assays, mobility shift assays, quantitative PCR, and proteomics methods as well as postmortem expression analysis for this work. RESULTS: Reporter assays showed that the insertion allele significantly increases promoter activity in multiple cell lines. The zinc finger transcription factor ZNF148 was found to significantly transactivate the promoter and increase expression when overexpressed but could not account for the differences in activity between the two alleles of the promoter. Copy number of the insertion sequence was associated with exponentially increasing activity of a downstream promoter, suggesting that the insertion sequence has enhancer activity when present in multiple copies. SLC6A1 promoter genotype was found to predict SLC6A1 RNA expression in human postmortem hippocampal samples. These results suggest that the insertion polymorphism leads to increased SLC6A1 promoter activity because, in part, of creation of an enhancer element when present as multiple copies. Genotyping individuals from Tanzania in this study suggested that the insertion allele has its origin in Africa. CONCLUSION: On account of the effect of the insertion on promoter activity, this relatively common polymorphism may prove useful in predicting clinical response to pharmacological modulators of SLC6A1 as well as GABAergic function in individuals of African descent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1097/FPC.0b013e328318b21a,"Adolescent;Adult;African Americans/genetics;Aged;Animals;Base Sequence;Case-Control Studies;Cell Line;DNA Primers/genetics;Enhancer Elements, Genetic;Female;GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism;Gene Expression;Hippocampus/metabolism;Humans;Male;Mice;Middle Aged;Minisatellite Repeats;Molecular Sequence Data;*Mutagenesis, Insertional;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Promoter Regions, Genetic;RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism;Schizophrenia/genetics;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Transcriptional Activation;Young Adult;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Receptors, GABA-A",19077666,PMC2791799

METHOD: We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to search for genetic variation affecting the susceptibility to side-effects. The analysis sample consisted of 1439 depression patients, successfully genotyped for 421K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. Outcomes included four indicators of side-effects: general side-effect burden, sexual side-effects, dizziness and vision/hearing-related side-effects. Our criterion for genome-wide significance was a prespecified threshold ensuring that, on average, only 10% of the significant findings are false discoveries. RESULTS: Thirty-four SNPs satisfied this criterion. The top finding indicated that 10 SNPs in SACM1L mediated the effects of bupropion on sexual side-effects (p = 4.98 × 10(-7), q = 0.023). Suggestive findings were also found for SNPs in MAGI2, DTWD1, WDFY4 and CHL1. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings require replication and functional validation, this study demonstrates the potential of GWAS to discover genes and pathways that could mediate adverse effects of antidepressant medication.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1017/S003329171100239X,"Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects;Bupropion/adverse effects;Citalopram/adverse effects;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/classification/*genetics;Factor Analysis, Statistical;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Linear Models;Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics;Membrane Proteins/genetics/physiology;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/chemically induced/genetics;Treatment Outcome;Antidepressive Agents",22041458,PMC3627503

Differential mitochondrial protein expressions were assessed using two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis for three groups with Chlorpromazine (CPZ), Clozapine (CLZ), quetiapine (QTP) and a control group.

METHOD: Patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) were assessed during 2006 and 2007 for response/nonresponse (defined as ≥ 20%/<20% improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] total score) after 2 weeks of risperidone treatment (2 to 6 mg/d). Responders continued risperidone treatment; nonresponders were randomly assigned to either risperidone or olanzapine treatment (10 to 20 mg/d) for an additional 10 weeks. Associations between change in PANSS total (primary outcome measure), positive, and negative scores and the 6 SNPs were examined in risperidone-treated patients (N = 145).

The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, has been associated with body weight and energy homeostasis, and abnormal regulation of leptin could play a role in weight gain induced by antipsychotics. We investigated whether a leptin gene promoter variant affected weight gain after long-term treatment with clozapine in chronic schizophrenia. Leptin G2548A polymorphism was genotyped in 102 Chinese Han inpatients with chronic schizophrenia treated with clozapine. Weight gains, expressed as change in body mass index (BMI), were monitored after long-term clozapine treatment. We found a significant relationship between the 3 leptin G/A genotypes and mean BMI gain (F(2,99) = 3.35, P = 0.039, r(2) = 0.09). Moreover, genotype had a strong effect on BMI gain in male (P = 0.004, r(2) = 0.16), but not in female patients (P > 0.05). Thus, variation in the leptin gene may be a risk factor for weight gain in male patients with schizophrenia on long-term clozapine treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/jcp.0b013e3180582412,"Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;*Asians;Body Mass Index;China;Chronic Disease;Clozapine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Female;Genotype;Humans;Leptin/blood/*genetics;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenetics;*Polymorphism, Genetic;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Weight Gain/*drug effects/genetics;Schizophrenia;Weight Gain;Clozapine;Polymorphism, Genetic;Leptin",17502770,
Could HTR2A T102C and DRD3 Ser9Gly predict clinical improvement in patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia?

METHODS: We consecutively recruited 100 schizophrenia patients and assessed clinical improvement after 4 weeks of risperidone treatment. RESULTS: The patients with T/T in the HTR2A gene showed less clinical improvement than did those with T/C or C/C (p = 0.044). In the case of the DRD3 gene, we did not find statically significant association with clinical improvement (p = 0.061). When patients were categorized into responders and nonresponders, the C allele was more frequent in responders (OR = 2.28, 95%CI = 1.06-4.91, p = 0.039). When combinations of the two polymorphisms were considered, patients who had T/T in the HTR2A gene and encoded Ser/Ser or Ser/Gly from DRD3 gene had a higher propensity to non-responsiveness compared to other subjects (OR = 3.57, 95%CI = 1.10-11.62, p = 0.039).

The present study aimed to examine whether the Taq1 A DRD2 genotypes are related to therapeutic response to nemonapride, a selective dopamine antagonist, in schizophrenic patients. The subjects were 25 acutely exacerbated schizophrenic inpatients who had received no medication for at least 1 month before the study. The fixed dose (18 mg/day) of nemonapride was administered to each patient for 3 weeks. The clinical status was prospectively monitored by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) before, and 3 weeks after, the treatment. The Taq1 A genotypes (A1 and A2 alleles) were determined by the polymerase chain reaction method. Three patients were homozygous for the A1 allele, 11 were heterozygous for the A1 and A2 alleles, and 11 were homozygous for the A2 allele. The patients with one or two A1 alleles (n = 14) showed significantly higher percentage improvement in total BPRS and positive symptoms than those with no A1 allele (n = 11) after 3-week treatment while the percentage improvement in other subgrouped symptoms (negative, anxiety-depression, excitement and cognitive symptoms) was similar between the two genotype groups. The present results suggest that the Taq1 A DRD2 polymorphism is related to early therapeutic response to nemonapride in schizophrenic patients, possibly by modifying the efficiency of DRD2 antagonism of the drug in the central nervous system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/00008571-200006000-00007,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use;Benzamides/blood/*therapeutic use;Dopamine Antagonists/blood/*therapeutic use;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;*Polymorphism, Genetic;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Taq Polymerase/*genetics;Dopamine Antagonists;Receptors, Dopamine D2;Polymorphism, Genetic",10862524,

We have recently introduced a mutation detection technique based on analysis of homo- and heteroduplex PCR fragments resolved in cycling temperature gradient conditions on a conventional multicapillary-array DNA sequencer. The main advantage of this technique is in its simplicity with no requirement for sample cleanup prior to the analysis. In this report we present a practical application of the technology for genotyping of SNP markers in two separate clinical projects resulting in a combined set of 44 markers screened in over 500 patients. Initially, a design of PCR primers and conditions was performed for each SNP marker. Then, optimization of CE running conditions (limited just to the proper selection of temperature cycling) was performed on pools of 20 DNA samples to increase the probability of having each of the two allele types represented in the sample. After selecting the optimum conditions, screening of markers in patients was performed using a multiple-injection approach for further acceleration of the sample throughput. The rate of successful optimization of experimental conditions without any pre-selection based on the SNP sequence or melting characteristics was 80% from the initial SNP marker candidates. By studying the failed markers, we attempt to identify critical factors enabling successful typing. The presented technique is very useful for low to medium sized SNP genotyping projects mostly applied in pharmacogenomic research as well as in clinical diagnostics.

We also did not observe any differentially methylated CpG sites between MDD and HC groups. After assessing functionality by correlating methylation levels with RNA expression of the respective genes, we observed that the number of functionally relevant CpG sites differed between MDD and HC groups in FKBP5 (χ(2) = 77.25, p < 0.0001) and NR3C1 (χ(2) = 7.29, p = 0.007). Cross-referencing functionally relevant CpG sites to those that were highly ranked in predicting HV in elastic net modeling identified one site from FKBP5 (cg03591753) and one from NR3C1 (cg20728768) within the MDD group. Stronger associations between DNA methylation, gene expression and HV in MDD suggest a novel putative molecular pathway of stress-related sensitivity in depression. Future studies should consider utilizing the epigenome and ultra-high field MR data which would allow the investigation of HV sub-fields.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.psyneuen.2021.105348,"Biomarkers/metabolism;Canada;*DNA Methylation/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/genetics/pathology;Humans;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology;*Hypothalamus/pathology;Organ Size;Pituitary-Adrenal System/physiology;Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/metabolism;*Stress, Psychological/genetics/physiopathology;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder;Hypothalamus;Methylation",34229186,
[Pharmacogenetics and treatment response in schizophrenia].,2007,12,,L'Encephale,0013-7006 (Print),33,6,954-64,Moulier V and Januel D,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18789788/,fre,,France,"The pharmacogenetic strategy uses the genetic association approach with the aim of identifying genes that influence clinical response to drug treatment. Association studies have focused mainly on neuroleptics (in particular clozapine) and variants in candidate genes of dopamine and serotonin systems in schizophrenic patients. Concerning the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor gene, the frequency of allele tyrosine (versus histidine) at 452 was greater among nonresponders, and homozygosity for the cytosine allele at 102 was more frequent among nonresponders. In the serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptor gene, a cysteine to serine substitution at 23 was considered as a predictor of good response to clozapine. Concerning the dopamine D2 receptor gene, the patients with one or two A1 alleles showed greater improvement than those with no A1 allele (Taq1A genotype). In addition, compared with patients who exhibited a Del allele at 141, patients with no Del allele showed better clinical response. Regarding the dopamine D3 receptor gene, the homozygous genotype serine/serine at 9 was found to be more frequent among the nonresponders. Finally, there was a possible relationship between the 48 bp variant number tandem repeat polymorphism in dopamine D4 receptor gene and response to neuroleptics. DISCUSSION: However, some results conflict with other data in the literature. The frequent difficulties in replication of pharmacogenetic findings can be explained by, among others: (i) the lack of a consistent definition of drug response; (ii) the use of different scales to evaluate response to treatment and the use of several cut-offs for the same scale; (iii) the sample heterogeneity and the small sample size; and (iv) the multigenic interactions. In order for research to progress, methodological consistency must be achieved, not only to form the basis of comparison among studies and to confirm or invalidate previous results, but also to allow for meta-analysis between the various studies. Nevertheless Kane et al. [Arch Gen Psychiatry 45 (1988) 789-796] have defined precise criteria of clinical response, but they are restrictive and quite difficult to set up in practice. Pharmacogenetic research has the following advantages: (i) it is based on the individual patient's genotype, invariable data in normal conditions, and can therefore be measured at any time during treatment; (ii) it uses reliable molecular biological techniques; and (iii) it is in constant progress because of the increasing amount of genomic information available. CONCLUSION: In future, a combination of several polymorphisms showing a strong association with a specific neuroleptic response could constitute a clinical test to predict the individual response to such treatment, and therefore participate in the prescription process. A research team has already proposed a combination of six polymorphisms implicating 5-HT(2A) receptor, 5-HT(2C) receptor, 5-HTTLPR, and H2 receptor genes [Lancet 355 (2000) 1615-1616], but this result has to be replicated. Until now, pharmacogenetics has focused on the global clinical response, but in the years to come, it could focus on the genes implied in the effects of treatments on specific symptoms and on physiological mechanisms that would explain how gene polymorphism can influence therapeutic response. This review aims to summarise recent advances and to present future clinical applications for pharmacogenetics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",10.1016/j.encep.2007.01.004,"Alleles;Humans;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A/*genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D3/genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D4/genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics",18789788,

Lithium's mechanism of action is complex, and while it modulates the function of hundreds of molecular targets, most of these effects could be unspecific and not relevant for its clinical efficacy. In this study, we applied an integrated analytical approach using genome-wide expression and genotyping data from BD patients to identify lithium-responsive genes that may serve as biomarkers of its efficacy. To this purpose, we tested the effect of treatment with lithium chloride 1 mM on the transcriptome of lymphoblasts from 10 lithium responders (LR) and 10 nonresponders (NR) patients and identified genes significantly influenced by the treatment exclusively in LR. These findings were integrated with gene-based analysis on genome-wide genotyping data from an extended sample of 205 BD patients characterized for lithium response. The expression of 29 genes was significantly changed by lithium exclusively in LR. Gene-based analysis showed that two of these genes, zinc finger protein 429 (ZNF429) and zinc finger protein 493 (ZNF493), were also significantly associated with lithium response. Validation with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the lithium-induced downregulation of ZNF493 in LR (p = .036). Using convergent analyses of genome-wide expression and genotyping data, we identified ZNF493 as a potential lithium-responsive target that may be involved in modulating lithium efficacy in BD. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence supporting the involvement of zinc finger proteins in lithium response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ajmg.b.32663,"Biomarkers, Pharmacological;Bipolar Disorder/*genetics;Computational Biology/methods;DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics;Female;Gene Expression Profiling/methods;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Genotype;Humans;Lithium/*metabolism/*pharmacology;Male;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods;Retrospective Studies;Transcription Factors/genetics;Transcriptome;Treatment Outcome;Zinc Fingers/genetics;Bipolar Disorder;Fingers;Genomics",30318722,PMC6230310

It has been observed that the olanzapine responses in schizophrenia treatment are different across individuals. However, prediction of this individual-specific olanzapine response requires in-depth knowledge of biomarkers of drug response. Here, we performed an integrative investigation on 238 Han Chinese SCZ patients to identify predictive biomarkers that were associated with the efficacy of olanzapine treatment. This study applied HaloPlex technology to sequence 143 genes from 79 Han Chinese SCZ patients. Our result suggested that there were 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had significant association with olanzapine response in Han Chinese SCZ patients. Using MassARRAY platform, we tested that if these 12 SNPs were also statistically significant in 159 other SCZ patients (independent cohort) and the combined 238 SCZ patients (composed of two tested cohorts). The result of this analysis showed that 2 SNPs were significantly associated with the olanzapine response in both independent cohorts (rs324026, P = 0.023; rs12610827, P = 0.043) and combined SCZ patient population (rs324026, adjust P = 0.014; rs12610827, adjust P = 0.012).

However, the clinical utility of information from genetic studies is compromised by their controversial results, primarily due to relatively small effect and sample sizes. Clinical, demographic, and environmental differences in patient cohorts further explain the lack of consistent results from these genetic studies. Furthermore, the availability of psychopharmacological expertise in interpreting clinically meaningful results from genetic assays has been a challenge, one that often results in suboptimal use of genetic testing in clinical practice. These limitations explain the difficulties in the translation of psychopharmacological research in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics from bench to bedside to manage increasingly treatment-refractory psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia. Although these shortcomings question the utility of genetic testing in the general population, the commercially available genetic assays are being increasingly utilized to optimize the effectiveness of psychotropic medications in the treatment-refractory patient population, including schizophrenia. In this context, patients with treatment-refractory schizophrenia are among of the most vulnerable patients to be exposed to the debilitating adverse effects from often irrational and high-dose antipsychotic polypharmacy without clinically meaningful benefits. The primary objective of this comprehensive review is to analyze and interpret replicated findings from the genetic studies to identify specific genetic biomarkers that could be utilized to enhance antipsychotic efficacy and tolerability in the treatment-refractory schizophrenia population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3390/bs11070097,Antipsychotic Agents;Genetic Testing,34209185,PMC8301006

In this study, we assessed sequence variations of the HTR3A gene. For this purpose, we established exon-specific primers and analysed DNA samples from 165 unrelated individuals including 70 schizophrenic patients, 48 patients with bipolar affective disorder and 47 healthy control persons using polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. We discovered six sequence variants, five of which represent polymorphisms. These polymorphisms could not be associated with schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder (P = 0.055-1). We also detected a missense mutation in exon 9 in a schizophrenic patient at a conserved position (Pro391Arg). To determine the incidence of this substitution an extended set of 358 schizophrenic patients and 155 control individuals was investigated. The Pro391Arg mutation was not detected in these schizophrenic patients and controls screened. However, a second missense mutation (Arg344His) was detected in one schizophrenic patient, but not in any of the controls. These results suggest that the observed mutations in HTR3A are rare and therefore do not play a major role in the aetiology of the disorder.

This study evaluated the impact of CYP2D6, 2C19 and 3A4 genetic polymorphisms on plasma concentrations of S-CIT and patient treatment response. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were recruited to the study and their depression symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The genetic polymorphisms *4, *5 and *10 on CYP2D6, *2, *3 and *17 on CYP2C19, and *18 on CYP3A4 were selected based on their function and respective allele frequencies in Asian populations. Polymorphisms were analyzed using the SNPstream genotyping system, PCR and direct sequencing methods. The steady-state serum concentrations of S-CIT and its metabolites S-desmethylcitalopram and S-didesmethylcitalopram were analyzed by HPLC. According to semiquantitative gene dose (SGD) and gene dose (GD) models for allele combinations of these polymorphisms, CYP2D6 was clustered into intermediate (0.5, 1 and 1.5 SGD) and extensive (2 SGD) metabolizers, while CYP2C19 was clustered into poor (0 GD) and extensive (1 and 2 GDs) metabolizers. RESULTS: The group of patients with intermediate CYP2D6 metabolism (0.5 SGD) had a significantly higher frequency of remitters from major depressive disorder during the 8-week treatment (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had significantly higher S-CIT serum levels than did extensive metabolizers at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (p < 0.05). The allele frequencies in CYP3A4*18 and CYP2C19*17 were too low to permit further subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 may be influencing S-CIT serum concentrations, and that specific CYP2D6 polymorphisms may be predicting patient treatment outcomes based on gene dosage analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.09.168,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/administration &           dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics;Biomarkers/analysis;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Citalopram/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics;Female;Gene Dosage;Gene Frequency;Humans;Male;Models, Genetic;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Predictive Value of Tests;Treatment Outcome;Polymorphism, Genetic;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Citalopram",20350136,

A promoter variant of the leptin (LEP) gene, -2548G/A (rs7799039), has been associated with AIWG in several studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate this association in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) sample, followed by meta-analysis. METHODS: We investigated the association between rs7799039 and AIWG in a sub-sample of European (N = 164) individuals from the CATIE study.

Brain D2 dopamine receptors are one of the major targets of neuroleptic treatment. The human D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene has three variants predicting the amino acid substitutions Ser311Cys, Pro310Ser and Val96Ala in the receptor protein.

Functional differences between dopamine receptor variants might be related to genetically determined differences in response to neuroleptic treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1097/00008571-199902000-00003,"Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology;Binding, Competitive;Brain/metabolism;CHO Cells;Colforsin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology;Cricetinae;Cyclic AMP/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis;Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists;GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism;Humans;*Mutation, Missense;Receptors, Dopamine D2/genetics/*metabolism;Humanities;Humanism;Receptors, Dopamine;Receptors, Dopamine D2;Antipsychotic Agents",10208638,
The pharmacogenetics of lithium response depends upon clinical co-morbidity.,2007,,,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,1177-1062 (Print),11,3,161-70,Bremer T and Diamond C and McKinney R and Shehktman T and Barrett TB and Herold C and Kelsoe JR,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17570738/,eng,,New Zealand,"BACKGROUND: Based on results from randomized, controlled clinical trials, lithium monotherapy or lithium with the addition of an antipsychotic remains a first-line treatment option for both acute and long-term mood stabilization in bipolar mania. However, response to lithium is poor in bipolar patients who exhibit clinical characteristics such as rapid cycling and mixed manic states, suggesting that they may have a biologically and genetically distinct form of bipolar disorder. A test that could predict response to lithium based upon genetic factors would have significant clinical value. METHODS: Eight clinical characteristics were assessed in 92 lithium responders and 92 nonresponders; all probands were from families recruited for linkage studies. Lithium response was rated retrospectively from a standardized interviews and medical records. Eight candidate genes were selected from those reported to be associated with susceptibility to illness, lithium response, or lithium mechanism of action. Sixty-seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in these subjects and analyzed for association with the defined clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Using q-value analysis for multiplicity correction, we found significant interactions between lithium response and SNPs (rs1387923 and rs1565445) in the gene encoding neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) and suicidal ideation, and between SNP rs2064721 in the gene encoding inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase (INPP1) and post-traumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: These data support the idea that response to lithium has a multi-genetic etiology dependent upon manifestations of other clinical co-diagnoses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/BF03256238,"Bipolar Disorder/complications/drug therapy/*genetics;Drug Resistance/*genetics;G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 3;Genetic Markers;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Lithium Compounds/*therapeutic use;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptor, trkB/genetics;Retrospective Studies;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*complications;Suicide/*psychology;beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases/genetics;Pharmacogenetics;Lithium",17570738,

The present study was designed to evaluate the potential influence of the Cys-124 variant on pharmacological properties of the receptor and to test for an involvement of the mutation in the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. Binding of [3H]5-carboxamidotryptamine ([3H]5-CT) and its competition with serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists were determined in COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type or the variant h5-HT1B receptor cDNA. In saturation experiments with [3H]5-CT, the maximum binding (Bmax) of the variant receptor was approximately 30% of the wild-type receptor. In competition experiments with 1 nM [3H]5-CT, the following serotonin receptor ligands exhibited a two to three times higher affinity for the mutant than for the wild-type receptor: dihydroergotamine, L-694,247, SB-216641, 5-CT, 5-HT, sumatriptan, RU24969 and methysergide (compounds listed at decreasing order of potency at the wild-type receptor). In contrast, the serotonin receptor antagonist ketanserin exhibited higher binding affinity for the wild-type than for the mutant h5-HT1B receptor and GR127939, (-)propranolol and BRL-15572 showed equal affinity for both types of receptor. Mutation screening of schizophrenic and bipolar patients revealed no relationship between the variant receptor and development of disease. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Cys-124 variant significantly affects the pharmacological properties of the h5-HT1B receptor. Carriers of the variant may exhibit differences in response to drugs acting on the h5-HT1B receptor or may develop side-effects to such agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",,"Animals;Base Sequence;Bipolar Disorder/genetics;COS Cells;Cysteine/*metabolism;DNA Primers;DNA, Complementary;Humans;Ligands;Protein Binding;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1B;Receptors, Serotonin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism;Schizophrenia/genetics;Humanities;Humanism",10208648,

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is a key determinant in the folate metabolism and previous studies reported a significant effect on AP-induced weight gain and related metabolic abnormalities. Thus, we investigated MTHFR gene variants and changes in several important metabolic parameters in AP-treated patients. In this study, two functional MTHFR polymorphisms, rs1801133 (C677T) and rs1801131 (A1298C), were investigated for changes in weight and metabolic parameters. Genotypic associations were evaluated in a large population (n = 347 including 66 first episode psychosis, FEP patients) treated mostly with clozapine and olanzapine. We did not detect any genotypic association with weight changes (p > 0.05) in our total sample and in the sample refined for ancestry and medication. In our allelic analyses, we observed a trend for the 677-C allele to be associated with weight gain in the total sample (p = 0.03). This effect appeared to be driven by the FEP patients where those carrying the C-allele gained, on average, twice as much weight. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant association between the C677T and the A1298C polymorphism with HDL cholesterol serum levels in patients (p = 0.031). Overall we did not detect a major effect of two functional MTHFR gene variants and AP-induced weight gain. However, our findings suggest an effect of the C677T polymorphism in FEP patients and changes in weight and cholesterol levels.

Personalizing psychiatric treatment based on pharmacogenetic testing has been proposed to help clinicians guide antidepressant selection and dosing. This systematic literature review assesses the two most robustly studied drug-metabolizing enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, and examines whether obtaining CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 testing can be used to predict antidepressant response or adverse drug reactions in order to improve clinical outcomes. In general, literature reviews published prior to 2013 indicated that results have been inconsistent linking CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to antidepressant treatment outcomes, suggesting that more evidence is required to support the clinical implementation of genotyping to predict outcomes. We thus performed an extensive and systematic literature review, focusing on studies published from 2013 through 2018. Sixteen studies were found to be relevant. The results yielded inconsistent findings, suggesting that CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 testing may predict response in certain individuals, but it remains unclear if this will translate to improved clinical outcomes. Further research is required to determine when pharmacogenetic testing should be utilized and in which populations it is indicated.

To detect genetic variants contributing to major depression, the authors performed a genome-wide association study using 1,636 cases of depression ascertained in the U.K. and 1,594 comparison subjects screened negative for psychiatric disorders. METHOD: Cases were collected from 1) a case-control study of recurrent depression (the Depression Case Control [DeCC] study; N=1346), 2) an affected sibling pair linkage study of recurrent depression (probands from the Depression Network [DeNT] study; N=332), and 3) a pharmacogenetic study (the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression [GENDEP] study; N=88). Depression cases and comparison subjects were genotyped at Centre National de Génotypage on the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. After applying stringent quality control criteria for missing genotypes, departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and low minor allele frequency, the authors tested for association to depression using logistic regression, correcting for population ancestry. RESULTS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BICC1 achieved suggestive evidence for association, which strengthened after imputation of ungenotyped markers, and in analysis of female depression cases. A meta-analysis of U.K. data with previously published results from studies in Munich and Lausanne showed some evidence for association near neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) on chromosome 3, but did not support findings at BICC1. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies several signals for association worthy of further investigation but, as in previous genome-wide studies, suggests that individual gene contributions to depression are likely to have only minor effects, and very large pooled analyses will be required to identify them.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09091380,"Adult;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology/*genetics;Female;Gene Frequency/genetics;Genetic Markers/genetics;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Male;Meta-Analysis as Topic;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Recurrence;United Kingdom/epidemiology;Genome;Genomics",20516156,

Risperidone Therapy and CYP2D6 Genotype.,2012,,,,,,,,Dean L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28520384/,eng,,Bethesda (MD),"Risperidone is the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication in the US. It is an atypical (second generation) antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe dementia, and irritability associated with autism. Risperidone is metabolized to the active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Individuals who carry two inactive copies of the CYP2D6 gene are termed “poor metabolizers” and may have a decreased capacity to metabolize risperidone. These individuals may be at a higher risk of adverse effects because of increased exposure to plasma risperidone, compared to normal metabolizers, who carry two active copies of CYP2D6. Individuals who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (who carry more than two functional copies of CYP2D6) may have a decreased response to therapy, resulting from lower steady-state risperidone concentrations. The FDA-approved drug label states that analysis of clinical studies involving a modest number of poor metabolizers (n=70) does not suggest that poor and extensive (normal) metabolizers have different rates of adverse effects (1). In addition, the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) recently changed its dosing recommendations to “no action is needed” for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking risperidone (2).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",,Risperidone;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Genotype,28520384,

These patients are generally defined as treatment-resistant and are eligible for clozapine treatment. Treatment-resistant patients show a more severe course of the disease, but it has been suggested that treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) may constitute a distinct phenotype that is more than just a more severe form of SCZ. TRS is heritable, and genetics has been shown to play an important role in modulating response to antipsychotics. Important efforts have been put into place in order to better understand the genetic architecture of TRS, with the main goal of identifying reliable predictive markers that might improve the management and quality of life of TRS patients. However, the number of candidate gene and genome-wide association studies specifically focused on TRS is limited, and to date, findings do not allow the disentanglement of its polygenic nature.

Interindividual variability in the glucuronidation of (S) oxazepam contrasted with that of (R) oxazepam.,1995,10,,Pharmacogenetics,0960-314X (Print),5,5,287-97,Patel M and Tang BK and Grant DM and Kalow W,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8563769/,eng,,England,"Although conjugation with glucuronic acid is a major process for converting many xenobiotics into hydrophilic, excretable metabolites, relatively little has been reported concerning interindividual variability of glucuronidation in human populations. Oxazepam, a therapeutically active metabolite of diazepam, is one of a number of C3-hydroxylated benzodiazepines for which glucuronide conjugation is the predominant pathway of biotransformation. The drug is normally formulated as a racemic mixture of inactive (R) and active (S) enantiomers. In the present study we have investigated the use of oxazepam as a potential probe drug for studying the variability of glucuronide conjugation, and for demonstrating the extent to which genetic factors may be responsible. In preliminary studies we determined oxazepam pharmacokinetics metabolite profiles after administration of racemic (R,S) oxazepam to eleven human volunteers. The (S) glucuronide was preferentially formed and excreted in nine of the eleven subjects. The ratios of (S) to (R) glucuronide metabolites (S/R ratios) were 3.87 +/- 0.79 (mean +/- SD) and 3.52 +/- 0.60 in urine and plasma, respectively. However, both ratios were significantly lower in two subjects (p < 0.01). In these two atypical subjects, the half-life of (R,S) oxazepam was also markedly longer (14.7 and 15.9 h) than in the other subjects (8.1 +/- 3.2 h). A good correlation (rs = 0.90) between the S/R-glucuronide ratio in urine and the plasma clearance of (R,S) oxazepam suggested that a low S/R ratio may be a marker of poor elimination of oxazepam. In further investigations, the drug was administered to 66 additional subjects. The S/R-glucuronide ratio in 8 h pooled urine was bimodally distributed, with 10% of all subjects possessing ratios below an apparent antimode of 1.9. A survey of the in vitro formation of oxazepam glucuronides by microsomes from 37 human livers also showed that 10% of the livers displayed an abnormally high apparent Michaelis constant (Km) for the formation of the (S) glucuronide, but not of the (R) glucuronide. These results suggest that the glucuronidation of the pharmacologically active (S) enantiomer of oxazepam is decreased in a significant percentage (10%) of Caucasian individuals. The observed in vitro differences in apparent kinetics of the S-glucuronidation reaction may reflect defects at the genetic level, leading to structural changes in the isozyme(s) of UDP-glucuronyltransferase that catalyse this reaction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1097/00008571-199510000-00004,Adult;Aged;Alzheimer Disease/metabolism;Female;Glucuronates/*metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Liver/metabolism;Male;Metabolic Clearance Rate;Oxazepam/blood/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics;Schizophrenia/metabolism;Stereoisomerism;Tissue Distribution;Tissue Donors;Oxazepam,8563769,

METHODS: CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes and clinical data were obtained for 150 consecutive, consenting hospital admissions with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and who were treated with psychotropic medications. Data analysis compared clinical measures of LDLc, HDLc, triglyceride and BMI with novel combinatory and substrate-specific CYP450 drug metabolism indices. RESULTS: We found that a greater metabolic reserve index score is related to lower LDLc and higher HDLc, and that a greater metabolic alteration index score corresponds with higher LDLc and lower HLDc values. We also discovered that the sertraline drug-specific indices correlated with cholesterol and triglyceride values. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we demonstrated how a multigene approach to CYP450 genotype analysis yields more accurate and significant results than single-gene analyses. Ranking the individual with respect to the population represents a potential tool for assessing risk of dyslipidemia in major depressive disorder patients who are being treated with psychotropics. In addition, the drug-specific indices appear useful for modeling a variable of potential relevance to an individual's risk of drug-related dyslipidemia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/bmm.11.33,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/genetics/metabolism;Biomarkers/blood;Body Mass Index;Cholesterol, HDL/blood;Cholesterol, LDL/blood;Cohort Studies;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics/metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism;Depressive Disorder, Major/complications/drug therapy/metabolism;Dyslipidemias/complications/*metabolism;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychotropic Drugs/*metabolism/therapeutic use;Risk Factors;Triglycerides/blood;Pharmacogenetics",21861666,PMC3225002

The contribution of common genetic variants to TD susceptibility has been investigated in recent years, but with limited success. The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential contribution of rare variants to TD vulnerability. In order to identify TD risk genes, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and gene-based collapsing analysis focusing on rare (allele frequency < 1%) and putatively deleterious variants (qualifying variants). 82 Jewish schizophrenia patients chronically treated with antipsychotics were included and classified as having severe TD or lack of any abnormal movements based on a rigorous definition of the TD phenotype. First, we performed a case-control, exome-wide collapsing analysis comparing 39 schizophrenia patients with severe TD to 3118 unrelated population controls. Then, we checked the potential top candidate genes among 43 patients without any TD manifestations. All the genes that were found to harbor one or more qualifying variants in patients without any TD features were excluded from the final list of candidate genes. Only one gene, regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 2 (RIMS2), showed significant enrichment of qualifying variants in TD patients compared with unrelated population controls after correcting for multiple testing (Fisher's exact test p = 5.32E-08, logistic regression p = 2.50E-08). Enrichment was caused by a single variant (rs567070433) due to a frameshift in an alternative transcript of RIMS2. None of the TD negative patients had qualifying variants in this gene. In a validation cohort of 140 schizophrenia patients assessed for TD, the variant was also not detected in any individual. Some potentially suggestive TD genes were detected in the TD cohort and warrant follow-up in future studies. No significant enrichment in previously reported TD candidate genes was identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first WES study of TD, demonstrating the potential role of rare loss-of-function variant enrichment in this pharmacogenetic phenotype.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109659,"Adult;Aged;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects;Case-Control Studies;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/*genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Schizophrenia/complications/drug therapy;Whole Exome Sequencing/*statistics & numerical data;Young Adult;Movement Disorders",31153890,

Clozapine Therapy and CYP Genotype.,2012,,,,,,,,Dean L and Kane M,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28520368/,eng,,Bethesda (MD),"Clozapine is one of the most effective antipsychotics available in the treatment of schizophrenia and the only antipsychotic found to be effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Clozapine is also used to reduce the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (1, 2). Compared with typical antipsychotics, clozapine is far less likely to cause movement disorders, known as extrapyramidal side effects, which include dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. However, there are significant risks associated with clozapine therapy that limits its use to only the most severely ill individuals who have not responded adequately to standard drug therapy. Most notably, because of the risk of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, clozapine treatment requires monitoring of white blood cell counts (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and in the US, the FDA requires that individuals receiving clozapine be enrolled in a computer-based registry (3). There is also a propensity for clozapine use to induce metabolic effects, resulting in substantial weight gain (1). Clozapine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily of enzymes. The CYP1A2 enzyme is the main CYP enzyme involved in clozapine metabolism, and CYP1A2 activity is a potential determinant of clozapine dose requirements (4). Other CYP enzymes involved in clozapine metabolism include CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 (5). The FDA-approved drug label states that a subset of the population (2–10%) have reduced activity of CYP2D6 (“poor metabolizers”[PMs]) and these individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine with typical standard doses. Therefore, the FDA states that a dose reduction may be necessary in individuals who are CYP2D6 PMs (Table 1) (1). However, the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG, Table 2) does not recommend dose alterations based on CYP2D6 genotype, though the gene-drug interaction is acknowledged (6). The DPWG further states that there is not a gene-drug interaction between CYP1A2 and clozapine due to the limited effect of known genetic variants on CYP1A2 function (6). Consequently, neither the FDA nor the DPWG recommend dose alterations based on CYP1A2 genotype. Additionally, clozapine clearance is affected by gender, tobacco use, and ethnicity, with further contributions from pharmacologic interactions. Females have lower CYP1A2 enzyme activity than males. Non-smokers have lower CYP1A2 activity than smokers and Asians and Amerindians have lower activity than Caucasians. Clozapine clearance can also be affected by co-medications that induce or inhibit CYP1A2 and the presence of inflammation or obesity (7, 8).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",,Clozapine;Genotype,28520368,

OBJECTIVE: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms were characterized using high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) in follow-up patients in psychiatry clinic as a preliminary preparation for personalized medicine. METHOD: Genotyping of CYP1A2*1F, CYP2C9 *2, *3, CYP2C19 *2, *3 and *17 and CYP2D6 *3, *4 was conducted in 101 patients using HRMA. Genotype and allele frequencies of the CYP variants were found to be in equilibrium with the Hardy-Weinberg equation. RESULTS: The frequency of the CYP1A2*1F allele in schizophrenia and bipolar disease was 0.694 and 0.255, respectively. The CYP2C9 allele frequencies were 0.087 (CYP2C9*2), and 0.549 (CYP2C9*3) for bipolar; 0.278 (CYP2C9*2) and 0.648 (CYP2C9*3) in schizophrenias. The CYP2C19*2 and *17 allele frequencies was 0.111 and 0.185 in schizophrenia and variant *2 was 0.117 and variant *17 was 0.255 in bipolar group. The frequency of the CYP2D6*3 allele was 0.027 in schizophrenias. The frequencies for the CYP2D6*4 variant were 0.092 and 0.096 in schizophrenia and bipolar groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: The knowledge in pharmacogenomic and also the developments in molecular genetics are growing rapidly. In future, this can be expected to provide new methodologies in the prediction of the activity in drug metabolizing enzymes. The HRMA is a rapid and useful technique to identify the genotypes for drug dosage adjustment before therapy in psychiatry patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.2174/1386207321666180619164726,"Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*metabolism;Bipolar Disorder/*metabolism;Gene Frequency/genetics;Genotype;Humans;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Precision Medicine/methods;Psychiatry/methods;Schizophrenia/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2;Schizophrenia;Polymorphism, Genetic;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6",29921201,

This study aimed at evaluating its effect on CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 activities in submitting psychiatric patients to phenotyping with dextromethorphan and mephenytoin, respectively, substrates of these enzymes, before and during a treatment with perazine. A total of 31 patients were phenotyped with dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) and mephenytoin (CYP2C19) before and after a 2-week treatment with 450 ± 51 mg/day (mean ± sd) perazine. At baseline, five patients appeared to be poor metabolizers (PM) of dextromethorphan and two patients of mephenytoin. The metabolic ratio (MR) of dextromethorphan/dextrorphan as determined in collected urine increased significantly (Wilcoxon; P < .0001) from baseline (0.39 ± 1.38 [mean ± sd]) till day 14 (1.46 ± 2.22). In 19 out of 26 extensive metabolizers (EM) of dextromethorphan, the phenotype changed from EM to PM. This suggests an almost complete inhibition of CYP2D6 by perazine and/or its metabolites. On the other hand, perazine (or some of its metabolites) did seemingly not inhibit CYP2C19. In conclusion, this study suggests that in patients treated with perazine and co-medicated with CYP2D6 substrates, there could be an increased risk of adverse effects as a consequence of a pharmacokinetic interaction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",10.1111/bcpt.13373,Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*pharmacology;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Dextromethorphan/*metabolism;Drug Interactions;Female;Humans;Male;Mephenytoin/*metabolism;Middle Aged;Perazine/*pharmacology;Phenotype;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/enzymology;Young Adult;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Perazine;Dextromethorphan,31814297,

The main reason behind this fact is the lack of confirmation in clinical studies for the assumed, and in animals confirmed, therapeutic results. This suggests low predictive value of animal studies for central nervous system disorders. One solution for identifying new possible targets is the application of genetics and genomics, which may pinpoint new targets based on the effect of genetic variants in humans. The present review summarizes such research focusing on depression and its therapy. The inconsistency between most genetic studies in depression suggests, first of all, a significant role of environmental stress. Furthermore, effect of individual genes and polymorphisms is weak, therefore gene x gene interactions or complete biochemical pathways should be analyzed. Even genes encoding target proteins of currently used antidepressants remain non-significant in genome-wide case control investigations suggesting no main effect in depression, but rather an interaction with stress. The few significant genes in GWASs are related to neurogenesis, neuronal synapse, cell contact and DNA transcription and as being nonspecific for depression are difficult to harvest pharmacologically. Most candidate genes in replicable gene x environment interactions, on the other hand, are connected to the regulation of stress and the HPA axis and thus could serve as drug targets for depression subgroups characterized by stress-sensitivity and anxiety while other risk polymorphisms such as those related to prominent cognitive symptoms in depression may help to identify additional subgroups and their distinct treatment. Until these new targets find their way into therapy, the optimization of current medications can be approached by pharmacogenomics, where metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms remain prominent determinants of therapeutic success.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.09.002,"Animals;Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Depression/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics;Epistasis, Genetic;Gene-Environment Interaction;Genetic Variation;Humans;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major",30189291,

Published guidelines for gene-drug pair analysis are available for prescriptions in psychiatry, but information on their utilization, barriers, and health outcomes in Latin America is limited. As a result, this work aimed at exploring current use, opinions, and perceived obstacles on PGx testing among psychiatrists in Chile, via an online, anonymous survey. Among 123 respondents (5.9% of registered psychiatrists in the country), 16.3% reported ever requesting a PGx test. The vast majority (95%) of tests were ordered by clinicians practicing in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. Having more than 20 years in practice was positively associated with prior use of PGx (p 0.02, OR 3.74 (1.19-11.80)), while working in the public health system was negatively associated (OR 0.30 (0.10-0.83)). Perceived barriers to local implementation included insufficient evidence of clinical utility, limited clinicians' knowledge on PGx and on test availability, and health systems' issues, such as costs and reimbursement. Despite the recognition of these barriers, 80% of respondents asserted that it is likely that they will incorporate PGx tests in their practice in the next five years. Given these results, we propose next steps to facilitate implementation such as further research in health outcomes and clinical utility of known and novel clinically actionable variants, growth in local sequencing capabilities, education of clinicians, incorporation of clinical decision support tools, and economic evaluations, all in local context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.3389/fphar.2021.657985,Pharmacogenetics,33935777,PMC8082421

Although currently available antidepressants are effective treatment options, more than 50% of the patients do not respond to the first administered antidepressant. In addition, in more than 25% with antidepressants-treated patients, adverse effects occur. Currently, the selection of treatment does not reflect objectively measurable data from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the understanding of the impact of genetic variants on clinical features such as drug metabolism has grown and can be used to develop tests that enable a patient-tailored individual treatment. In fact, robust evidence was found that genetic variants of CYP450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 can be surrogate markers for the metabolism of certain drugs. This article describes a pilot study design aimed to combine clinical variables such as therapeutic drug monitoring, inflammatory and stress markers with static and variable genetic information of depressed patients to develop an algorithm that predicts treatment response, and tolerability using machine learning algorithms. Psychometric evaluation covers the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and adverse drug reactions. An in-depth (epi-)genetic assessment combines genome-wide gene association data with DNA methylation patterns of genes coding CYP enzymes along with a pharmacogenetic battery focusing on CYP enzymes. Using these measures to stratify depressed patients, this approach should contribute to a data-driven assessment and management of MDD, which can be referred to as precision medicine or high-definition medicine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: protocol",10.1055/a-0914-3234,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Genetic Testing/*methods;Hospitals, University/*organization & administration;Humans;Pharmacogenomic Testing/*methods;Pilot Projects;Precision Medicine;Predictive Value of Tests;Pharmacogenetics",31185510,

The orexin gene and its receptors are expressed in the hypothalamus and have been associated with maintenance of energy homeostasis. In this study, we have analysed tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in orexin receptors 1 and 2 (HCRTR1 and HCRTR2) for association with AIWG. METHODS: Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder subjects (n = 218), treated mostly with clozapine and olanzapine for up to 14 weeks, were included. Replication was conducted in a subset of CATIE samples (n = 122) treated with either olanzapine or risperidone for up to 190 days. Association between SNPs and AIWG was assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline weight and duration of treatment as covariates. RESULTS: Several SNPs in HCRTR2 were nominally associated with AIWG in patients of European ancestry treated with either clozapine or olanzapine (P<0.05). In the replication analysis two SNPs rs3134701 (P = 0.043) and rs12662510 (P = 0.012) were nominally associated with AIWG. None of the SNPs in HCRTR1 were associated with AIWG.

Recent evidence has implicated the complement cascade in diseases involving the central nervous system, including schizophrenia. Here, we provide an up-to-date narrative review and critique of the literature on the relationship between schizophrenia and complement gene polymorphisms, gene expression, protein concentration, and pathway activity. A literature search identified 23 new studies since the first review on this topic in 2008. Overall complement pathway activity appears to be elevated in schizophrenia. Recent studies have identified complement component 4 (C4) and CUB and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1) as potential genetic markers of schizophrenia. In particular, there is some evidence of higher rates of C4B/C4S deficiency, reduced peripheral C4B concentration, and elevated brain C4A mRNA expression in schizophrenia patients compared to controls. To better elucidate the additive effects of multiple complement genotypes, we also conducted gene- and gene-set analysis through MAGMA which supported the role of Human Leukocyte Antigen class (HLA) III genes and, to a lesser extent, CSMD1 in schizophrenia; however, the HLA-schizophrenia association was likely driven by the C4 gene. Lastly, we identified several limitations of the literature on the complement system and schizophrenia, including: small sample sizes, inconsistent methodologies, limited measurements of neural concentrations of complement proteins, little exploration of the link between complement and schizophrenia phenotype, and lack of studies exploring schizophrenia treatment response. Overall, recent findings highlight complement components-in particular, C4 and CSMD1-as potential novel drug targets in schizophrenia.

Genetic variations within the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene region, a major representative of the brain neurotrophins, are suggested to influence response to antidepressant treatment. Specifically, we recently identified two BDNF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs2049046 and rs11030094, as associated with antidepressant treatment response in a large pharmacogenetic study of hospitalized patients. We now analyzed these two SNPs in a sub-sample for their association with HPA axis dysregulation using the combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin releasing hormone challenge (dex/CRH) test at hospital admission (N = 266) and at discharge (N = 190). Rs11030094, located 3' outside the coding region of BDNF, is also located in an intron of BDNFOS coding for a functional antagonist of BDNF. We further included the non-synonymous Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism in our analysis, for which - albeit being extensively studied - conflicting results in respect to its role in antidepressant treatment response have been reported. Similar to the previous analysis, rs2049046 and rs11030094 showed a significant effect on antidepressant response. In a gene-dose dependent manner, we found significant lower cortisol responses to the dex/CRH test at discharge in carriers of the respective SNP alleles ('T' of rs2049046 and 'G' of rs11030094) that were associated with antidepressant response (beneficial alleles). These genetic effects on HPA axis regulation were independent of age, sex, medication and depressive symptomatology. Although not reaching statistical significance, the same direction of effect was observed for cortisol at admission, as well as the ACTH response at admission and discharge. An interaction analysis of both SNPs revealed highest cortisol levels in subjects that were non-carriers of both beneficial alleles. The Val66Met (rs6265) was neither associated with antidepressant response nor with HPA axis regulation. Our findings provide further evidence for an interaction of the HPA axis and the neurotrophin system in major depression. This study stresses the importance investigating BDNF variants beyond the extensively studied Val66Met polymorphism. In-depth analyses of both pathophysiologically relevant systems may point to possible new targets for pharmaceutical intervention and precision medicine of major depression in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109686,"Adult;Alleles;Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Genotype;Humans;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*physiopathology;*Introns;Male;Middle Aged;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Treatment Outcome;Polymorphism, Genetic",31295515,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility and sample sizes required to explore the relationship between CYP2B6*6 and GRIN2B single-nucleotide polymorphisms and ketamine-induced EP. METHODS: This cross-sectional, pharmacogenetic candidate, gene pilot study recruited 75 patients having minor elective outpatient surgeries. EP was measured with the Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale. Genetic association of CYP2B6*6 and GRIN2B (rs1019385 and rs1806191) single-nucleotide polymorphisms and ketamine-induced EP occurrence and severity were tested using logistic and linear regression. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (63%) received ketamine and were genotyped, and 40% of them experienced EP. Occurrence and severity of EP were not associated with CYP2B6*6 or GRIN2B (p > .10). Exploratory analysis of nongenotype models containing age, ketamine dose, duration of anesthesia, and time from ketamine administration to assessment for EP significantly predicted EP occurrence (p = .001) and severity (p = .007). This pilot study demonstrates feasibility for implementing a pharmacogenetic study in a clinical setting, and we estimate that between 380 and 570 cases will be needed to adequately power future genetic association studies.

The SLC6A3 40 base variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism has been associated with several clinical phenotypes associated with dysregulation of dopamine transmission. However, there is only little evidence about a possible influence of such genetic variant on the response to antipsychotics. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether SLC6A3 40 base VNTR polymorphism could modulate response to risperidone in a sample of Korean schizophrenia subjects. Methods. One hundred and forty-two schizophrenia inpatients were treated with a flexible dose of risperidone. Efficacy was assessed at baseline and at discharge using the scores of the Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Positive and Negative Symptom Score (PANSS). Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to test possible influences of SLC6A3 VNTR variants on clinical scores. Results. None of the genotypes and of the alleles under investigation was associated with clinical scores at discharge or with changes of clinical scores over time. In addition, we also failed to find any association between genotypes and allele frequency distribution in accordance with treatment response defined as a 20% (or 30%) or more reduction in the total PANSS scores from the baseline to the end of treatment. Conclusion. Our findings do not suggest a possible association between SLC6A3 40 base VNTR polymorphism and response to risperidone. However, because of several limitations including the investigation of a single drug, the flexible design of the present study and the absence of a complete coverage of features which could influence the response, further investigations could be required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.3109/13651501.2010.486902,"Risperidone;Polymorphism, Genetic",24917325,

Through drug-gene network analysis, we found that seven atypical antipsychotic drugs tended to form two clusters that could be defined by drugs with different target receptor profiles. In the drug-drug interaction network, we found that three drugs (zuclopenthixol, ziprasidone, and thiothixene) tended to have more adverse drug interactions than others, while clozapine had fewer adverse drug interactions.

Treatment-Resistant Depression Revisited: A Glimmer of Hope.,2021,2,23,Journal of personalized medicine,2075-4426 (Print),11,2,,Halaris A and Sohl E and Whitham EA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33672126/,eng,,,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide. It causes individual suffering, loss of productivity, increased health care costs and high suicide risk. Current pharmacologic interventions fail to produce at least partial response to approximately one third of these patients, and remission is obtained in approximately 30% of patients. This is known as Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). The burden of TRD exponentially increases the longer it persists, with a higher risk of impaired functional and social functioning, vast losses in quality of life and significant risk of somatic morbidity and suicidality. Different approaches have been suggested and utilized, but the results have not been encouraging. In this review article, we present new approaches to identify and correct potential causes of TRD, thereby reducing its prevalence and with it the overall burden of this disease entity. We will address potential contributory factors to TRD, most of which can be investigated in many laboratories as routine tests. We discuss endocrinological aberrations, notably, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and thyroid and gonadal dysfunction. We address the role of Vitamin D in contributing to depression. Pharmacogenomic testing is being increasingly used to determine Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Cytochrome P450, Serotonin Transporter, COMT, folic acid conversion (MTHFR). As the role of immune system dysregulation is being recognized as potentially a major contributory factor to TRD, the measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and select immune biomarkers, where testing is available, can guide combination treatments with anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., selective COX-2 inhibitors) reversing treatment resistance. We focus on established and emerging test procedures, potential biomarkers and non-biologic assessments and interventions to apply personalized medicine to effectively manage treatment resistance in general and TRD specifically.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3390/jpm11020155,,33672126,PMC7927134

Recently, a naturally occurring variation (ProArg) in the second intracellular loop of the human (h) 5-HT3A receptor was identified in a schizophrenic patient. Because the substitution of proline, an alpha-imino acid, by arginine may affect the conformation of the whole receptor, the aim of the present study was to determine the pharmacological and functional properties of this variant compared to the wild-type receptor in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Studies of binding of [H]GR65630, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, to membranes (saturation and competition experiments with 5-HT3 receptor ligands) and patch-clamp studies of agonist-induced currents in outside-out patches were carried out. In comparison to the wild-type, the variant receptor exhibited no changes in the receptor density and the affinities for nine representative ligands (five agonists and four antagonists). The potencies and efficacies of three 5-HT3 receptor agonists in inducing currents through the ion channel and the potencies of two 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in blocking 5-HT-evoked currents did not differ between wild-type and variant receptors. In addition, there were no differences in the desensitization kinetics of both receptor isoforms. In conclusion, the ArgPro variation of the h5-HT3A receptor does not change ligand binding to the h5-HT3A receptor, nor does it modify current through the receptor channel.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1097/00008571-200403000-00004,"Binding, Competitive;Cell Membrane/*metabolism;Electrophysiology;*Genetic Variation;Humans;Imidazoles/*metabolism;Indoles/*metabolism;Ion Channels/physiology;Kidney/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism;Kinetics;Leucine/chemistry;Ligands;Mutagenesis, Site-Directed;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Proline/chemistry;Protein Binding;Radioligand Assay;Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3/*metabolism;Serotonin/metabolism;Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor Agonists;Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists;Serotonin Antagonists/pharmacology;Serotonin Receptor Agonists/pharmacology;Humanities;Humanism",15167704,

The goal of this review is to consider different generations of sequencing techniques and their application to exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing and their clinical applications. In recent decades, exome sequencing has primarily been used in patient studies. Discussed in some detail, are important measures that have been developed to standardize variant calling and to assess pathogenicity of variants. Examples of cases where exome sequencing has facilitated diagnosis and led to improved medical management are presented. Whole genome sequencing and its clinical relevance are presented particularly in the context of analysis of nucleotide and structural genomic variants in large population studies and in certain patient cohorts. Applications involving analysis of cell free DNA in maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis of specific autosomal trisomies are reviewed. Applications of DNA sequencing to diagnosis and therapeutics of cancer are presented. Also discussed are important recent diagnostic applications of DNA sequencing in cancer, including analysis of tumor derived cell free DNA and exosomes that are present in body fluids.

This study explored the differential expression of regulatory genes between patients with schizophrenia (chronic and antipsychotic-naïve first-episode patients) and healthy controls in order to identify candidate genes for association with antipsychotic treatment response. Seven candidate differentially expressed genes were identified, and four variants within these genes were found to be significantly associated with treatment response (DNMT3A rs2304429, HDAC5 rs11079983, and HDAC9 rs1178119 and rs11764843).

We thus attempted to elucidate a genetic signature which could predict patients' response to AAP monotherapy. Our logistic regression analyses indicated the probability that 76% patients carrying combination of four SNPs will not show favorable response to AAP therapy. The robustness of this prediction model was assessed using repeated 10-fold cross validation method, and the results across n-fold cross-validations (mean accuracy=71.91%; 95%CI=71.47-72.35) suggest high accuracy and reliability of the prediction model.

The mood stabilizing properties of lithium were first reported in 1949 by John Cade, and since then it has been considered the first line treatment for bipolar disorder. Despite presenting more differences than similarities, mood stabilizers are all characterized by high variability in response in treated patients. This feature has stimulated a vast body of research on potential predictive markers of clinical response, with promising but often inconclusive findings. Pharmacogenetics of mood stabilizers has provided valuable hints toward the involvement of genes and pathways in modulating response. However, with the exception of lithium, the number of studies is still too sparse to draw definite conclusions. Moreover, the mechanism of action of these drugs has yet to be completely elucidated. A growing body of research has explored the effect of mood stabilizers on a family of molecular players responsible for the regulation of gene expression without interfering with the DNA sequence. These processes belong to the epigenetic machinery and represent the mechanisms through which our biological systems interact with environmental factors, including drug treatments. In this review we focused on findings from preclinical and clinical studies suggesting that mood stabilizers may interfere with epigenetic mechanisms, providing an intriguing perspective that may help us filling the gap between molecular functions and clinical efficacy of mood stabilizers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.neulet.2016.06.045,"Antimanic Agents/*pharmacology;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics/psychology;Carbamazepine/pharmacology;Epigenesis, Genetic;Epigenomics;Humans;Lithium Compounds/pharmacology;Mood Disorders/drug therapy/genetics/psychology;Valproic Acid/pharmacology;Bipolar Disorder",27343410,

Ongoing efforts are aimed to establish drug selection processes aimed to preemptive evaluation of a plethora of factors affecting patient's specific drug response, including pharmacogenomic markers, in order to minimize prescription of improper medications. In previous years, we established at the University Hospital Sant'Andrea of Rome, Italy, a Precision Medicine Service based on a multi-disciplinary experts' team. The team is in charge to produce a drug therapy counselling report, including pharmacogenomic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of this established ""manual"" process of therapy selection with a novel bioinformatic tool, the Drug-PIN system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 200 patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorders or a depressive episode in Bipolar Disorder, with at least three previous failed treatments, who underwent pharmacogenomic profiling and therapy counselling in the Sant'Andrea Hospital from 2017 to 2020. The baseline poly-therapy of these patients was re-evaluated and optimized by Drug-PIN. Results of the Drug-PIN poly-therapy evaluation/optimization were compared with the results of the original poly-therapy evaluation/optimization by therapy counselling. To compare the results between the two processes, the risk associated with each poly-therapy was classified as low, moderate, or high. RESULTS: The number of baseline poly-therapies classified in low-, moderate- or high-risk did not change significantly between manual system or Drug-PIN system. As the counselling process, also the Drug-PIN system produces a significant decrease in the predicted treatment-associated risk. CONCLUSION: Drug-PIN substantially replicates the output of the counselling process, allowing a substantial reduction in the time needed for therapy evaluation. Availability of an effective bioinformatic tool for proper drug selection is expected to exponentially increase the actuation of targeted therapy strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.2147/PGPM.S316556,Computational Biology;Pharmacogenetics;Drug Evaluation,34385834,PMC8352633

The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an interesting candidate for genetic studies of TD because it regulates the release of neurotransmitters implicated in TD, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. VMAT2 is also a target of tetrabenazine, a drug used in the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders, including TD. We examined nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC18A2 gene that encodes VMAT2 for association with TD in our sample of chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 217).

We further found the rs363224 marker to interact with the putative functional D2 receptor rs6277 (C957T) polymorphism (p = 0.001), supporting the dopamine hypothesis of TD.

Based on this epidemiology, we hypothesized that there were gene profiles playing opposite roles in pathogenesis of schizophrenia and glioma. METHODS: Based on GEO datasets and TCGA, key genes of schizophrenia genes on the opposite development of glioma were screened by different expressed genes (DEGs) screening, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), disease-specific survival (DSS), and glioma grading and verified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). RESULTS: First, 612 DEGs were screened from schizophrenia and control brain samples. Second, 134 key genes more specific to schizophrenia were left by WGCNA, with 93 key genes having annotations in TCGA. Third, DSS of glioma helped to find 42 key gene expressions of schizophrenia oppositely associated with survival of glioma. Finally, 24 key genes showed opposite expression trends in schizophrenia and different glioma grading, i.e., the upregulated key genes in schizophrenia expressed increasingly in higher grade glioma, and vice versa. CAMK2D and MPC2 were taken as the examples and evaluated by GSEA, which indeed showed opposite trends in the same pathways of schizophrenia and glioma. CONCLUSION: This workflow of selecting novel targeted genes which may have opposite roles in pathogenesis of two diseases was firstly and innovatively generated by our team. Some filtered key genes were indeed found by their potential effects in several mechanism studies, indicating our process could be effective to generate novel targeted genes.

Interestingly, the tamoxifen-inducible NMDAR deletion during this late developmental stage did not induce behavioral alterations resembling depression, schizophrenia or anxiety. Our data indicate that post-adolescent NMDAR deletion, even in a wider cell population than parvalbumin-positive interneurons, is also not sufficient to generate behavioral abnormalities resembling psychiatric disorders.

Two enzymes involved in the phospholipase C signalling system, namely the myo-inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and the inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (IPPase), have been postulated as targets for the therapeutic action of lithium in manic-depressive illness. Intriguingly, Drosophila mutants lacking IPPase activity display a defect in synaptic transmission, and this alteration could be phenocopied by lithium exposure. We recently demonstrated the presence of several polymorphisms in the IPPase-encoding inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase gene (INPP1) cDNA and suggested that polymorphic variants of the human IPPase might be associated with the striking difference in lithium response among bipolar patients. We report the genomic structure and organization of the INPP1 gene on chromosome 2q32. Based on DNA sequencing of the entire genomic region containing INPP1, we found that the gene consists of six exons and spans more than 25 kb. Expression analysis showed that INPP1 is present as a 1.9 kb mRNA transcript in all organs and tissues examined, including the central nervous system. The level of expression varies, with at least a fourfold higher transcript level in testis compared with other tissues with high expression. A highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat, (CA)18-25, with an observed heterozygosity of 0.86 was detected immediately downstream of the gene.

Nineteen SNPs were annotated as active regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters in a tissue-specific manner.

While the discovery of pharmacogenomic variants of clozapine metabolism may improve clinical management, no robust findings have yet been reported. This study is the first to adopt the framework of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to discover genetic markers of clozapine plasma concentrations in a large sample of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHODS: The authors used mixed-model regression to combine data from multiple assays of clozapine metabolite plasma concentrations from a clozapine monitoring service and carried out a genome-wide analysis of clozapine, norclozapine, and their ratio on 10,353 assays from 2,989 individuals. These analyses were adjusted for demographic factors known to influence clozapine metabolism, although it was not possible to adjust for all potential mediators given the available data. GWAS results were used to pinpoint specific enzymes and metabolic pathways and compounds that might interact with clozapine pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: The authors identified four distinct genome-wide significant loci that harbor common variants affecting the metabolism of clozapine or its metabolites. Detailed examination pointed to coding and regulatory variants at several CYP* and UGT* genes as well as corroborative evidence for interactions between the metabolism of clozapine, coffee, and tobacco. Individual effects of single single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fine-mapped from these loci were large, such as the minor allele of rs2472297, which was associated with a reduction in clozapine concentrations roughly equivalent to a decrease of 50 mg/day in clozapine dosage.

Pharmacogenomics in the treatment of mood disorders: Strategies and Opportunities for personalized psychiatry.,2017,9,,The EPMA journal,1878-5077 (Print),8,3,211-227,Amare AT and Schubert KO and Baune BT,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29021832/,eng,,,"Personalized medicine (personalized psychiatry in a specific setting) is a new model towards individualized care, in which knowledge from genomics and other omic pillars (microbiome, epigenomes, proteome, and metabolome) will be combined with clinical data to guide efforts to new drug development and targeted prescription of the existing treatment options. In this review, we summarize pharmacogenomic studies in mood disorders that may lay the foundation towards personalized psychiatry. In addition, we have discussed the possible strategies to integrate data from omic pillars as a future path to personalized psychiatry. So far, the progress of uncovering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underpinning treatment efficacy in mood disorders (e.g., SNPs associated with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors or lithium treatment response in patients with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder) are encouraging, but not adequate. Genetic studies have pointed to a number of SNPs located at candidate genes that possibly influence response to; (a) antidepressants COMT, HTR2A, HTR1A, CNR1, SLC6A4, NPY, MAOA, IL1B, GRIK4, BDNF, GNB3, FKBP5, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and ABCB1 and (b) mood stabilizers (lithium) 5-HTT, TPH, DRD1, FYN, INPP1, CREB1, BDNF, GSK3β, ARNTL, TIM, DPB, NR3C1, BCR, XBP1, and CACNG2. We suggest three alternative and complementary strategies to implement knowledge gained from pharmacogenomic studies. The first strategy can be to implement diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic genetic testing based on candidate genes or gene products. The second alternative is an integrative analysis (systems genomics approach) to combine omics data obtained from the different pillars of omics investigation, including genomics, epigenomes, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiomes. The main goal of system genomics is an identification and understanding of biological pathways, networks, and modules underlying drug-response. The third strategy aims to the development of multivariable diagnostic or prognostic algorithms (tools) combining individual's genomic information (polygenic score) with other predictors (e.g., omics pillars, neuroimaging, and clinical characteristics) to finally predict therapeutic outcomes. An integration of molecular science with that of traditional clinical practice is the way forward to drug discoveries and novel therapeutic approaches and to characterize psychiatric disorders leading to a better predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) in psychiatry. With future advances in the omics technology and methodological developments for data integration, the goal of PPPM in psychiatry is promising.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1007/s13167-017-0112-8,Mood Disorders;Pharmacogenetics,29021832,PMC5607053

METHODS: Due to our interest in these disorders we performed complementary DNA (cDNA) hybridization selection on genomic DNA clones spanning this region to identify potential positional-candidate genes. RESULTS: We identified a full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 2883 bp corresponding to a predicted protein of 961 amino acids that shares greater than 95% homology with the rat gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor. Northern blot hybridization identified a 4.4-kb transcript in human brain. The human gene mapped to two sites on 6p21.3 separated by 2 Mb. Sequence analysis of both sites showed that the centromeric gene is transcribed, whereas the telomeric site is likely a pseudogene. The transcribed gene is distributed over 22 exons spanning 18 kb of genomic DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic location, tissue expression, and function of the human GABAB receptor gene suggest that it is an important positional-candidate for the neurobehavioral disorders with a genetic locus on 6p21.3.

We studied the dopamine D3 receptor ser9gly, the dopamine D2 receptor Taq IA and the 5-HT2C receptor promoter -759C/T polymorphisms in 117 patients who had symptoms assessed by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) on admission and following 10-week antipsychotic treatment, primarily with risperidone or chlorpromazine. The D2 polymorphism was found not to be significantly associated with baseline levels or changes in total PANSS in these patients. The D3 genotype is associated with the change in total PANSS (p<0.01), an effect reflecting positive and general (each p<0.01) but not negative symptom improvement. However, symptom improvement at 10 weeks strongly correlates with total PANSS score on admission, in which the greater improvement is seen with the more severe initial symptom score. The D3 genotype is also related to severity on admission, i.e. to total baseline PANSS (p<0.05), including baseline PANSS score as a covariate, the association of the genotype to change over 10 weeks remains significant for total PANSS (p<0.05) and for positive and general, but not negative, symptom scores. The 5-HT2C promoter polymorphism was also associated with improvement in PANSS (p<0.05), but reflecting effects on negative and general, but not positive, symptom scores. This polymorphism was not associated with PANSS score on admission, although after controlling for the effect of this parameter on 10-week outcome, a stronger association with change in total PANSS (p<0.01) was apparent, again reflecting improvements in negative and general symptoms but not changes in positive symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.euroneuro.2004.07.001,"Alleles;Analysis of Variance;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Chi-Square Distribution;Female;Humans;Male;Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C/*genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D3;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic",15695058,

This time period is of critical importance in the emergence of several neuropsychiatric disorders accompanied by cognitive impairment, such as affective disorders and schizophrenia. The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes at neuronal level during this specific developmental stage remains however poorly understood. GluA1-containing AMPA receptors, which are located predominantly on hippocampal neurons, are the primary molecular determinants of synaptic plasticity. We investigated here the consequences of the inducible deletion of GluA1 AMPA receptors in glutamatergic neurons during late adolescence. We generated mutant mice with a tamoxifen-inducible deletion of GluA1 under the control of the CamKII promoter for temporally and spatially restricted gene manipulation. GluA1 ablation during late adolescence induced cognitive impairments, but also marked hyperlocomotion and sensorimotor gating deficits. Unlike the global genetic deletion of GluA1, inducible GluA1 ablation during late adolescence resulted in normal sociability. Deletion of GluA1 induced redistribution of GluA2 subunits, suggesting AMPA receptor trafficking deficits. Mutant animals showed increased hippocampal NMDA receptor expression and no change in striatal dopamine concentration. Our data provide new insight into the role of deficient AMPA receptors specifically during late adolescence in inducing several cognitive and behavioral alterations with possible relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1002/hipo.22236,"Animals;Cognition Disorders/*metabolism;Corpus Striatum/growth & development/*metabolism;Dopamine/metabolism;Hippocampus/growth & development/*metabolism;Maze Learning/physiology;Memory, Short-Term;Mental Disorders;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Motor Activity/physiology;Neurons/*metabolism;Phenotype;Receptors, AMPA/genetics/*metabolism;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/metabolism;Sensory Gating/physiology;*Social Behavior;Receptors, AMPA;Adolescent;alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid",24339333,

Using pharmacokinetic (PK) models in adolescents, we sought to (1) model SSRI dosing across CYP2C19 phenotypes to compare SSRI exposure (area under curve, AUC) and maximum concentration (C(max)), (2) evaluate the impact of b.i.d. dosing (in rapid metabolizers [RM] and ultrarapid metabolizers [UM]) on SSRI exposure and C(max), and (3) determine pharmacogenomically-informed dosing strategies to provide similar exposure across CYP2C19 phenotypes in adolescents. Methods: Using PK parameters in CYP2C19 phenotype groups and previously reported pediatric PK data for escitalopram and sertraline, we modeled exposure (AUC(0-24)) and C(max) and determined CYP2C19-guided dosing strategies. Results: Compared with normal CYP2C19 metabolizers treated with either escitalopram or sertraline, C(max) and AUC(0-24) were higher in slower metabolizers and lower in patients with increased CYP2C19 activity, although the magnitude of these differences was more pronounced for escitalopram than for sertraline. For escitalopram, poor metabolizers (PMs) require 10 mg/day and UMs require 30 mg/day to achieve an exposure that is equivalent to 20 mg/day in a normal metabolizer (NM). For sertraline, to achieve AUC(0-24) and C(max) similar to NMs receiving 150 mg/day, PMs require 100 mg/day, whereas a dose of 200 mg/day was required in rapid and UMs. For UMs, b.i.d. escitalopram dosing was necessary to achieve comparable trough levels and exposure to NMs. Conclusions: This simulation study raises the possibility that achieving similar escitalopram and sertraline plasma concentrations could require dose adjustments in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and UMs, although the magnitude of these differences were more pronounced for escitalopram than for sertraline.

Our group has completed studies in pharmacogenomics and metabolomics that have independently identified perturbations in one-carbon metabolism as associated with risk factors for CVD in this patient population. Therefore, this study aimed to use genetic and metabolomic data to determine the relationship between folate pharmacogenomics, one-carbon metabolites, and insulin resistance as measured using the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as a marker of CVD. Methods: Participants in this pilot analysis were on a stable atypical antipsychotic regimen for at least 6 months, with no diabetes diagnosis or use of antidiabetic medications. Participant samples were genotyped for MTHFR variants rs1801131 (MTHFR A1298C) and rs1801133 (MTHFR C677T). Serum metabolite concentrations were obtained with NMR. A least squares regression model was used to predict log(HOMA-IR) values based on the following independent variables: serum glutamate, glycine, betaine, serine, and threonine concentrations, and carrier status of the variant alleles for the selected genotypes. Results: A total of 67 participants were included, with a median age of 47 years old (IQR 42-52), 39% were female, and the median BMI was 30.3 (IQR 26.3-37.1). Overall, the model demonstrated an ability to predict log(HOMA-IR) values with an adjusted R (2) of 0.44 and a p-value of < 0.001. Glutamate, threonine, and carrier status of the MTHFR 1298 C or MTHFR 677 T allele were positively correlated with log(HOMA-IR), whereas glycine, serine, and betaine concentrations trended inversely with log(HOMA-IR). All factors included in this final model were considered as having a possible effect on predicting log(HOMA-IR) as measured with a p-value < 0.1. Conclusions: Presence of pharmacogenomic variants that decrease the functional capacity of the MTHFR enzyme are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, as measured in this instance by log(HOMA-IR). Furthermore, serine, glycine, and betaine concentrations trended inversely with HOMA-IR, suggesting that increased presence of methyl-donating groups is associated with lower measures of insulin resistance.

Genotyping was performed for nine SNPs (HTR2C: rs498207, rs3813928, rs6318 and rs3813929; INSIG2: rs17587100, rs10490624, rs17047764 and rs7566605; LEP: rs7799039). Association analysis included logistic regression analysis and Pearson s chi(2) tests. RESULTS: We report a significant association of three HTR2C SNPs (rs498207, rs3813928 and rs3813929) and of the respective haplotype with antipsychotic-induced BWG. Regarding the X-chromosomal SNP rs498207, individuals with AA/A genotype gained more weight than those with GG/G genotype. The association observed with the SNP rs498207 was also significant after correcting for multiple testing (p = 0.0196). No association was found for INSIG2 and LEP SNPs. CONCLUSION: The results contribute to the accumulating evidence for an association of the X-chromosomal HTR2C gene with antipsychotic-induced BWG. The proposed underlying mechanisms include decreased HTR2C gene expression with reduced 5-HT-modulated activation of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin-neurons, and inverse 5-HT(2C) agonism in the presence of D(2) receptor antagonism.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.10.50,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Female;Genes, X-Linked;Genotype;Germany;Humans;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics;Leptin/*genetics;Logistic Models;Male;Membrane Proteins/*genetics;Middle Aged;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C/*genetics;Retrospective Studies;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/genetics;Weight Gain/*drug effects/genetics;Young Adult;Antipsychotic Agents;Weight Gain",20504252,

The disorder is characterised by marked inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. In most cases, symptoms can be treated by catecholamine-releasing drugs, such as methylphenidate. Children with ADHD are at higher risk for substance abuse and oppositional, conduct and mood disorders. Familial and adoption studies shed light on the genetic vulnerability of ADHD. Twin studies estimated the broad heritability to range between 40% and 90%. The mode of transmission is yet unknown, but is likely polygenic. Molecular genetic studies in ADHD should contribute to a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder (genetics of the vulnerability), and could help to select a more rational type of treatment (pharmacogenetic). Family-based association studies already performed are reviewed in this manuscript. Association studies, using haplotype relative risk (HRR) or transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) have focused on candidate genes which code for proteins potentially involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder. Genes involved in dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalin systems have thus been assessed for their role in core features of ADHD, such as motor overactivity, inattention, and impulsiveness. According to a meta-analysis, the DAT1 gene, an obvious candidate gene in ADHD vulnerability, does not appear to be involved (OR = 1.13, p = 0.21). On the other hand, DRD4 (OR = 1.26, p = 0.01) and DRD5 (OR = 1.4, p = 0.01) are significantly associated to ADHD according to the present meta-analysis, confirming previous ones. Recent studies showed a trend for an association between one allele of the 5-HTT (considering case-control studies) and DBH (OR = 1.27, p = 0.06) genes and ADHD, but these positive findings have to be replicated. ADHD is a complex disorder with potentially many different risk factors. Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity could explain why some association studies are positive, whereas others are negative. For instance, different developmental pathways are likely to lead to similar clinical outcomes. More clear-cut phenotypes, such as ADHD with conduct disorder, or ADHD with bipolar disorder, could be more homogenous, the genes involved being therefore more easy to detect. These phenotypes are beginning to be specifically studied in molecular genetics. In addition, the development of pharmacogenetics could help to identify predictors of clinical response for a specific type of treatment, which would be clearly helpful in clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",10.1016/s0013-7006(05)82405-4,"Alleles;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*genetics/metabolism;Child;Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism;Haplotypes;Humans;Norepinephrine/genetics/metabolism;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Protein Transport/genetics;Proteins/*genetics/metabolism;Receptors, Dopamine D4/*genetics;Receptors, Estrogen;Risk Factors;Serotonin/genetics/metabolism;Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity",16389711,

We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed clinical trials for an association between the use of PGx-guided antidepressant therapy and depressive symptom remission in patients with major depressive disorder. We included prospective, controlled clinical trials published in English up to July 12, 2022. Data extraction and synthesis adhered to the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Each trial was assessed for risk of bias and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled risk ratios. Thirteen trials comprising 4767 patients were analyzed, including 10 randomized controlled trials and three open label trials. Across all included trials, those that received PGx-guided antidepressant therapy (n = 2395) were 1.41 (95% CI: 1.15 - 1.74, p = 0.001) more likely to achieve remission compared to those that received unguided antidepressant therapy (n = 2372). Pooled risk ratios for randomized controlled trials and open label trials were 1.46 (95% CI: 1.13 - 1.88) and 1.26 (95% CI: 0.84-1.88), respectively. These results suggest that PGx-guided antidepressant therapy is associated with a modest but significant increase in depressive symptom remission in adults with major depressive disorder. Efforts to address the heterogeneity in PGx test composition (i.e., genes and alleles tested) and accompanying prescribing recommendations across trials will likely reduce the uncertainty about the efficacy of PGx-guided antidepressant therapy in the literature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1002/cpt.2748,Pharmacogenetics,36111494,

No clinical tool is available for predicting lithium response or the occurrence of side effects in everyday clinical practice. Multiple genetic research efforts have been performed in this field because lithium response and side effects are considered to be multifactorial endophenotypes. Available results from linkage and segregation, candidate-gene, and genome-wide association studies indicate a role of genetic factors in determining response and side effects. For example, candidate-gene studies often report GSK3β, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and SLC6A4 as being involved in lithium response, and the latest genome-wide association study found a genome-wide significant association of treatment response with a locus on chromosome 21 coding for two long non-coding RNAs. Although research results are promising, they are limited mainly by a lack of replicability and, despite the collaboration of consortia, insufficient sample sizes. The need for larger sample sizes and ""multi-omics"" approaches is apparent, and such approaches are crucial for choosing the best treatment options for patients with bipolar disorder.

The aetiology of psychiatric disorders is a complex combination of both genetic and environmental components. While potential susceptibility genes for psychiatric disorders have been identified, interaction with the environment is a crucial component in disease development. Pharmacogenetics and genetic testing have the potential to play key roles in the future of clinical psychiatry. At present, an increased risk of psychiatric disorders can be identified through a detailed family history. The empirical risk of developing a disorder has been determined for many psychiatric disorders and can be used as a general guide. Genetic counselling can extend and enhance patient care by providing information to patients about the complexities of inheriting psychiatric disorders and the associated risks of recurrence. The genetic counselling process can facilitate informed decision making, alleviate misconceptions and reduce stigma through an improved understanding of the genetic cause of psychiatric disorders, and offer support to patients and their families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.5694/j.1326-5377.2006.tb00666.x,Adult;*Genetic Counseling;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/psychology;Humans;Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/psychology;Counseling,17137456,

Since then, studies both confirming and not confirmnning this finding were reported. However, a meta-analysis of a large number of Caucasian alcoholics (both more severe and less severe) and controls (both assessed and unassessed for substance use disorders) revealed a significantly higher frequency (p < 10(-6)) and prevalence (p < 10(-8)) of the DRD2 A1 allele in the alcoholics. Further analysis showed that the more severe alcoholics had a 3-fold higher prevalence of the DRD2 A1 allele than the assessed controls (p < 10(-10)), whereas no difference was found between the less severe alcoholics and the unassessed controls. DRD2 exonic or promoter mutations have not yet been associated with alcoholism, although two intronic variants at the TaqIB and intron 6 sites, which are in linkage disequilibrium with the TaqIA site, were associated with this disorder. Variants of the DRD2 gene have also been associated with cocaine, nicotine and opioid dependence, obesity and gambling. It is hypothesised that the DRD2 is a reinforcement or reward gene. Although less intensively studied than substance use disorders, the DRD2 gene has been implicated in Tourette's syndrome (TS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and certain symptoms associated with affective disorders and schizophrenia. Further, DRD2 variants have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in iatrogenically-induced movement disorders, as well as in certain migraineurs. Phenotypic differences have been associated with DRD2 variants. These include reduced D2 dopamine receptor numbers and diminished glucose metabolism in the brain of subjects who carry the DRD2 A1 allele. In addition, phenotypic differences have been found in neurocognitive and personality characteristics, and in treatment outcome of DRD2 variants. The involvement of the DRD2 gene in certain neuropsychiatric disorders opens up the potential of a targeted pharmacogenomic approach to the prevention and treatment of these disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.1517/14622416.1.3.309,"Animals;Humans;Mental Disorders/*genetics/metabolism;Nervous System Diseases/*genetics/metabolism;Phenotype;Receptors, Dopamine D2/drug effects/*genetics;Nervous System Diseases",11256581,

However, the functional significance of rs2514218, the top DRD2 single nucleotide polymorphism in the GWAS, is unknown. Dopamine D2 receptor binding is a common mechanism of action for all antipsychotic drugs, and DRD2 variants were related to antipsychotic response in previous studies. The present study examined whether rs2514218 genotype could predict antipsychotic response, including efficacy and adverse events, in a cohort of patients with first episode of psychosis treated with either risperidone or aripiprazole for 12 weeks. Subjects were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium HumanOmniExpressExome array platform. After standard quality control, data from 100 subjects (49 randomly assigned to treatment with aripiprazole and 51 assigned to risperidone) was available for analysis. Subjects were assessed for psychotic symptomatology and medication-related adverse events weekly for 4 weeks, then biweekly for 8 weeks. Linear mixed model analysis revealed that the homozygotes for the risk (C) allele at rs2514218 had significantly greater reduction in positive symptoms during 12 weeks of treatment compared to the T allele carriers. In the aripiprazole group, C/C homozygotes also reported more akathisia than the T allele carriers, while in the risperidone group, male T allele carriers demonstrated greater prolactin elevations compared to male C/C homozygotes. These findings suggest that the schizophrenia risk variant at the DRD2 locus (or another variant in close proximity) is associated with observable differences in response to treatments which reduce striatal dopamine signaling.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1093/schbul/sbv116,"Adolescent;Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology;Aripiprazole/administration & dosage/*pharmacology;Female;Genetic Loci;Humans;Male;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;*Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy/genetics;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics;Risk;Risperidone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology;*Schizophrenia/drug therapy/genetics;Young Adult;Schizophrenia;Antipsychotic Agents;Psychotic Disorders",26320194,PMC4601717

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of data from a blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing two active treatment arms. SETTING: Psychiatry specialty and primary care clinics across 60 U.S. community and academic sites. PARTICIPANTS: Adults age 65 years or older at baseline (n = 206), diagnosed with MDD and inadequate response to at least one medication on the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test report during the current depressive episode. INTERVENTION: Combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing to inform medication selection (guided-care), compared with treatment as usual (TAU). OUTCOMES: Mean percent symptom improvement, response rate, and remission rateat week 8, measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; medication switching; and comorbidity moderator analysis. RESULTS: At week 8, symptom improvement was not significantly different for guided-care than for TAU (∆ = 8.1%, t = 1.64, df = 187; p = 0.102); however, guided-care showed significantly improved response (∆ = 13.6%, t = 2.16, df = 187; p = 0.032) and remission (∆ = 12.7%, t = 2.49, df = 189; p = 0.014) relative to TAU.

Most antipsychotic drugs influence dopaminergic transmission through blocking dopamine receptors, primarily DRD2. We report here the post-transcriptional regulation of DRD2 expression by two brain-expressed microRNAs (miRs), miR-326 and miR-9, in an ex vivo mode, and show the relevance of miR-mediated DRD2 expression regulation in human dopaminergic neurons and in developing human brains. Both miRs targeted the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of DRD2 in NT2 (neuron-committed teratocarcinoma, which endogenously expresses DRD2) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines, decreasing luciferase activity measured by a luciferase reporter gene assay. miR-326 overexpression reduced DRD2 mRNA and DRD2 receptor synthesis. Both antisense miR-326 and antisense miR-9 increased DRD2 protein abundance, suggesting an endogenous repression of DRD2 expression by both miRs. Furthermore, a genetic variant (rs1130354) within the DRD2 3'-UTR miR-targeting site interferes with miR-326-mediated repression of DRD2 expression. Finally, co-expression analysis identified an inverse correlation of DRD2 expression with both miR-326 and miR-9 in differentiating dopaminergic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and in developing human brain regions implicated in schizophrenia. Our study provides empirical evidence suggesting that miR-326 and miR-9 may regulate dopaminergic signaling, and miR-326 and miR-9 may be considered as potential drug targets for the treatment of disorders involving abnormal DRD2 function, such as schizophrenia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1074/jbc.M113.535203,"Animals;CHO Cells;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Dopaminergic Neurons/*metabolism/pathology;*Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology;MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*biosynthesis/genetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology;Humanities;Humanism;MicroRNAs;Receptors, Dopamine D2",24675081,PMC4036351

SUMMARY: Iloperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that recently received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the acute treatment of schizophrenia. Iloperidone is a pure antagonist and the first antipsychotic to have pharmacogenomic studies indicate predictive response based on six identified polymorphisms. Pharmacokinetic studies have determined that iloperidone is well absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of 96%. Phase II and III clinical trials have shown iloperidone to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, based on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scores (p < 0.05). Iloperidone has established tolerability at recommended dosages of up to 24 mg daily; however, the dosage must be slowly increased over seven days, and twice-daily administration is required to avoid orthostatic hypotension. The most common adverse effects associated with iloperidone were dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal congestion, orthostatic hypotension, somnolence, tachycardia, and weight gain. Safety studies have also found that iloperidone increases the risk of Q-Tc interval prolongation, similar to that seen with ziprasidone. Minimal changes in glucose and lipid abnormalities were seen in short-term (4- and 6-week) and long-term (52-week) studies, indicating a low chance of metabolic disturbance with iloperidone. CONCLUSION: Iloperidone may be a viable and safe option for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients, especially for patients who cannot tolerate other antipsychotic agents. However, iloperidone lacks a clear benefit over other antipsychotic agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.2146/ajhp100079,"Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Interactions;Humans;Isoxazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Piperidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/genetics;Schizophrenia",21289324,

PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Psychosis is caused by interactions with other drugs or by pharmacogenetic vulnerabilities that cause heightened responses to chloroquine or mefloquine alone, mediated through dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, P-glycoprotein, inhibited cortical activity, deranged calcium homeostasis, and impaired synaptogenesis. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Retrospective studies can identify all other drugs taken coincident with chloroquine or mefloquine psychosis. Various genes from patients could be cloned and compared to those from individuals who tolerated chloroquine and mefloquine, culminating with transgenic animal studies. Identification of candidate genes may be aided by pharmacogenomic analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism maps. Finally, prospective studies with cerebrospinal fluid analysis and PET scanning could help verify the hypothesis. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If this hypothesis is correct, the incidence of chloroquine and mefloquine psychosis can be greatly reduced by avoiding interacting medications and by conducting genetic screening prior to initiating chloroquine and mefloquine. Validation of the hypothesis would also provide a paradigm to follow for avoiding neuropsychiatric side effects if antidepressants and neuroleptics are used to overcome chloroquine resistance, if new antimalarial drugs chemically related to chloroquine and mefloquine are developed and if chloroquine and mefloquine are used for non-malarial applications such as HIV and cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.059,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists &           inhibitors/metabolism;Antimalarials/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Chloroquine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Drug Interactions;Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology;Humans;Loperamide/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Mefloquine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Mental Disorders/chemically induced/drug therapy;Psychotic Disorders/*epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology;Pharmacogenetics;Chloroquine;Mefloquine;Psychotic Disorders",16843615,

The present study was designed to validate hitherto suggested candidate genes on CLZ pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and explore new markers through an integrative study. METHODS: Based on a literature review, a total of 127 variations in 27 candidate genes were selected and analyzed. Ninety-six schizophrenic patients of Korean ethnicity with constant CLZ dosing were recruited, and information on body weight and smoking habits was gathered, as well as plasma drug levels and treatment responses. RESULTS: Among the pharmacokinetic-related single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2069521 and rs2069522 in CYP1A2 for CLZ/(dose/weight) and norclozapine/(dose/weight) and rs1135840 in CYP2D6 for norclozapine/CLZ showed borderline associations that were insignificant after correction for multiple testing.

We searched for systematic review articles that have simultaneously investigated the effects of as many different markers as possible on the response to antidepressant therapy in major depressive patients. From these we extracted markers that have been found to be significant by at least two independent review studies and that have proven replicable also within each of these reviews.

Based on our results, onset time, symptom severity, presence of anhedonia, early treatment response, comorbid anxiety, alcohol consumption, frontal EEG theta activity, hippocampal volume, activity of anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a peripheral marker, serum BDNF levels have proven replicable predictors of antidepressant response.

In this review, we focus on the latest developments for pharmacogenomics research using machine learning and deep learning approaches together with neuroimaging and multi-omics data. First, we review relevant pharmacogenomics studies that leverage numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to determine treatment prediction and potential biomarkers for antidepressant treatments in MDD. In addition, we depict some neuroimaging pharmacogenomics studies that utilize various machine learning approaches to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes in MDD based on the integration of research on pharmacogenomics and neuroimaging. Moreover, we summarize the limitations in regard to the past pharmacogenomics studies of antidepressant treatments in MDD. Finally, we outline a discussion of challenges and directions for future research.

Is It Possible to Predict the Future in First-Episode Psychosis?,2018,,,Frontiers in psychiatry,1664-0640 (Print),9,,580,Suvisaari J and Mantere O and Keinänen J and Mäntylä T and Rikandi E and Lindgren M and Kieseppä T and Raij TT,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30483163/,eng,,,"The outcome of first-episode psychosis (FEP) is highly variable, ranging from early sustained recovery to antipsychotic treatment resistance from the onset of illness. For clinicians, a possibility to predict patient outcomes would be highly valuable for the selection of antipsychotic treatment and in tailoring psychosocial treatments and psychoeducation. This selective review summarizes current knowledge of prognostic markers in FEP. We sought potential outcome predictors from clinical and sociodemographic factors, cognition, brain imaging, genetics, and blood-based biomarkers, and we considered different outcomes, like remission, recovery, physical comorbidities, and suicide risk. Based on the review, it is currently possible to predict the future for FEP patients to some extent. Some clinical features-like the longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), poor premorbid adjustment, the insidious mode of onset, the greater severity of negative symptoms, comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs), a history of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation and having non-affective psychosis-are associated with a worse outcome. Of the social and demographic factors, male gender, social disadvantage, neighborhood deprivation, dysfunctional family environment, and ethnicity may be relevant. Treatment non-adherence is a substantial risk factor for relapse, but a small minority of patients with acute onset of FEP and early remission may benefit from antipsychotic discontinuation. Cognitive functioning is associated with functional outcomes. Brain imaging currently has limited utility as an outcome predictor, but this may change with methodological advancements. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) might be useful as one component of a predictive tool, and pharmacogenetic testing is already available and valuable for patients who have problems in treatment response or with side effects. Most blood-based biomarkers need further validation. None of the currently available predictive markers has adequate sensitivity or specificity used alone. However, personalized treatment of FEP will need predictive tools. We discuss some methodologies, such as machine learning (ML), and tools that could lead to the improved prediction and clinical utility of different prognostic markers in FEP. Combination of different markers in ML models with a user friendly interface, or novel findings from e.g., molecular genetics or neuroimaging, may result in computer-assisted clinical applications in the near future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00580,Psychotic Disorders,30483163,PMC6243124

We undertook analysis of these results with the aim of applying epigenetic knowledge to aid variant discovery and interpretation. METHODS: We applied conditional imputation to results from 26 genome-wide association studies and three candidate gene-association studies. The analysis workflow included data from chromatin conformation capture, chromatin state annotation, DNase I hypersensitivity, hypomethylation, anatomical localization and biochronicity. We also made use of chromatin state data from the epigenome roadmap, transcription factor-binding data, spatial maps from published Hi-C datasets and 'guilt by association' methods. RESULTS: We identified 31 pharmacoepigenomic SNPs from a total of 2024 variants in linkage disequilibrium with lead SNPs, of which only 6% were coding variants. Interrogation of chromatin state using our workflow and the epigenome roadmap showed agreement on 34 of 35 tissue assignments to regulatory elements including enhancers and promoters. Loop boundary domains were inferred by association with CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin, suggesting proximity to topologically associating domain boundaries and enhancer clusters. Spatial interactions between enhancer-promoter pairs detected both known and previously unknown mechanisms. Addiction and analgesia SNPs were common in relevant populations and exhibited large effect sizes, whereas a SNP located in the promoter of the SLC1A2 gene exhibited a moderate effect size for lithium response in bipolar disorder in patients of European ancestry. SNPs associated with drug-induced organ injury were rare but exhibited the largest effect sizes, consistent with the published literature. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that an in silico bioinformatics-based approach using integrative analysis of a diversity of molecular and morphological data types can discover pharmacoepigenomic variants that are suitable candidates for further validation in cell lines, animal models and human clinical trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.15.105,"Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics;Chromatin/genetics;Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics;Chromosome Mapping/*methods;Computational Biology;Computer Simulation;DNA Methylation;Deoxyribonuclease I/genetics;Epigenomics/*methods;Genetic Variation;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychotropic Drugs/*pharmacology;Transcription Factors/genetics;Whites;Psychotropic Drugs;Epigenomics",26340055,

Making predictions based on genetic markers holds promise for improving the remission rate. However, genetic variants found in previous genetic studies do not provide robust evidence to aid pharmacogenetic decision-making in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using genomic DNA to identify genetic variants associated with the treatment outcomes of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We performed WGS on 100 patients with MDD who were treated with escitalopram (discovery set: 36 remitted and 64 non-remitted). The findings were applied to an additional 553 patients with MDD who were treated with SSRIs (replication set: 185 remitted and 368 non-remitted). A novel loss-of-function variant (rs3213755) in keratin-associated protein 1-1 (KRTAP1-1) was identified in this study. This rs3213755 variant was significantly associated with remission following antidepressant treatment (p = 0.0184, OR 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-7.80 in the discovery set; p = 0.00269, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.22-2.53 in the replication set). Moreover, the expression level of KRTAP1-1 in surgically resected human temporal lobe samples was significantly associated with the rs3213755 genotype.

METHODS: Seventy-one adolescents (14-20 years; 38BD, 33HC) underwent 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Region of interest (ROI) and vertex-wise analyses examined cortical volume, surface area (SA), and thickness, as well as subcortical volume. ROIs included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), putamen, and amygdala. General linear models included main effects of diagnosis and rs1006737, and an interaction term, controlling for age, sex, and total intracranial volume. RESULTS: Vertex-wise analysis found significant BD-by-rs1006737 interactions for prefrontal and occipital regions such that BD A-carriers were found to have greater SA relative to BD non-carriers, while HC A-carriers had reduced SA relative to HC non-carriers. ROI analysis found an interaction in the ACC such that BD A-carriers were found to have greater SA relative to BD non-carriers, while no significant difference was found in HCs. Main effects of rs1006737 were also found on ACC SA from ROI analysis, and occipital SA from vertex-wise analysis, such that A-carriers had larger SA relative to non-carriers in both of these regions.

Genome-wide changes in prefrontal cortex gene expression revealed alterations of 146 transcripts in the PCP treatment group compared to vehicle controls. Dysregulated genes were enriched in identified classes implicated in neurological and genetic disorders, including schizophrenia genes from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 108 loci as well as cell death in PCP-treated primates. Canonical pathway analysis revealed a significant overrepresentation of several groups including synaptic long-term potentiation and calcium signaling. Olanzapine coadministered with PCP normalized 34% of the 146 PCP-induced probe set expression changes, and a network of 17 olanzapine-normalized genes was identified enriched in schizophrenia candidate genes containing RGS4, SYN1 and AKT as nodes. The results of this study support the use of PCP administration in non-human primates as a glutamatergic model of schizophrenia and suggest that a large number of PCP-induced expression differences can be reversed by olanzapine.

METHODS: To examine the genetic factor for CIAG, a genome-wide pharmacogenomic analysis was conducted using 50 subjects with CIAG and 2905 control subjects. RESULTS: We identified a significant association in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs1800625, p = 3.46 × 10(-9), odds ratio [OR] = 3.8); therefore, subsequent HLA typing was performed. We detected a significant association of HLA-B*59:01 with CIAG (p = 3.81 × 10(-8), OR = 10.7) and confirmed this association by comparing with an independent clozapine-tolerant control group (n = 380, p = 2.97 × 10(-5), OR = 6.3). As we observed that the OR of CIA (OR: 9.3~15.8) was approximately double that in CIG (OR: 4.4~7.4), we hypothesized that the CIG subjects were a mixed population of those who potentially would develop CIA and those who would not develop CIA (non-CIA). This hypothesis allowed the proportion of the CIG who were non-CIA to be calculated, enabling us to estimate the positive predictive value of the nonrisk allele on non-CIA in CIG subjects. Assuming this model, we estimated that 1) ~50% of CIG subjects would be non-CIA; and 2) ~60% of the CIG subjects without the risk allele would be non-CIA and therefore not expected to develop CIA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HLA-B*59:01 is a risk factor for CIAG in the Japanese population. Furthermore, if our model is true, the results suggest that rechallenging certain CIG subjects with clozapine may not be always contraindicated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.12.006,Adult;Agranulocytosis/*chemically induced/*genetics;Alleles;Asians/genetics;Case-Control Studies;Clozapine/*adverse effects;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Genotype;HLA-B Antigens/*genetics;Histocompatibility Testing;Humans;Male;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;Risk Factors;Sensitivity and Specificity;Young Adult;Clozapine;Agranulocytosis;Pharmacogenetics,26876947,

This study evaluated PK and PD genetic variation and the clinical use of such testing in treatment seeking patients with bipolar disorder (BP) and major depressive disorder (MDD) and history of multiple drug failures/treatment resistance. Methods: Consecutive depressed patients evaluated at the Mayo Clinic Depression Center over a 10-year study time frame (2003-2013) were included in this retrospective analysis. Diagnoses of BP or MDD were confirmed using a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Clinical rating scales included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD(24)), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire. Clinically selected patients underwent genotyping of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6/CYP2C19 and the serotonin transporter SLC6A4.

Results: Of the 1795 patients, 167/523 (31.9%) with BP and 446/1272 (35.1%) with MDD were genotyped. Genotyped patients had significantly higher self-report measures of depression and anxiety compared to non-genotyped patients. There were significantly more CYP2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes in BP (9.3%) vs. MDD patients (1.7%, p = 0.003); among participants with an S-allele, the rate of CYP2C19 PM phenotype was even higher in the BP (9.8%) vs. MDD (0.6%, p = 0.003).

An integrative gene expression analysis was performed in four different mouse tissues (striatum, liver, pancreas and adipose) after risperidone or olanzapine treatment. The analytical approach combined the identification of the gene co-expression modules related to AP treatment, gene set enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network construction. We found several co-expression modules of genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis, hormone regulation and other processes related to metabolic impairment. Among these genes, EP300, which encodes an acetyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation, was identified as the most important hub gene overlapping the networks of both APs. Then, we explored the genetically predicted EP300 expression levels in a cohort of 226 patients with first-episode psychosis who were being treated with APs to further assess the association of this gene with metabolic alterations. The EP300 expression levels were significantly associated with increases in body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and triglyceride concentrations after 6 months of AP treatment.

Structural neuroimaging phenotypes of a novel multi-gene risk score in youth bipolar disorder.,2021,6,15,Journal of affective disorders,1573-2517 (Electronic),289,,135-143,Cazes J and Dimick MK and Kennedy KG and Fiksenbaum L and Zai CC and Patel R and Islam AH and Tampakeras M and Freeman N and Kennedy JL and MacIntosh BJ and Goldstein BI,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33979723/,eng,,Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is among the most heritable psychiatric disorders, particularly in early-onset cases, owing to multiple genes of small effect. Here we examine a multi-gene risk score (MGRS), to address the gap in multi-gene research in early-onset BD. METHODS: MGRS was derived from 34 genetic variants relevant to neuropsychiatric diseases and related systemic processes. Multiple MGRS were calculated across a spectrum of inclusion p-value thresholds, based on allelic associations with BD. Youth participants (123 BD, 103 healthy control [HC]) of European descent were included, of which 101 participants (58 BD, 43 HC) underwent MRI T1-weighted structural neuroimaging. Hierarchical regressions examined for main effects and MGRS-by-diagnosis interaction effects on 6 regions-of-interest (ROIs). Vertex-wise analysis also examined MGRS-by-diagnosis interactions. RESULTS: MGRS based on allelic association p≤0.60 was most robust, explaining 6.8% of variance (t(226)=3.46, p=.001). There was an MGRS-by-diagnosis interaction effect on ventrolateral prefrontal cortex surface area (vlPFC; β=.21, p=.0007). Higher MGRS was associated with larger vlPFC surface area in BD vs. HC. There were 8 significant clusters in vertex-wise analyses, primarily in fronto-temporal regions, including vlPFC. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional design, modest sample size. CONCLUSIONS: There was a diagnosis-by-MGRS interaction effect on vlPFC surface area, a region involved in emotional processing, emotional regulation, and reward response. Vertex-wise analysis also identified several clusters overlapping this region. This preliminary study provides an example of an approach to imaging-genetics that is intermediate between candidate gene and genome-wide association studies, enriched for genetic variants with established relevance to neuropsychiatric diseases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.040,Adolescent;*Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/genetics;Cross-Sectional Studies;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuroimaging;Phenotype;Risk Factors;Bipolar Disorder,33979723,
Molecular pathway analysis associates alterations in obesity-related genes and antipsychotic-induced weight gain.,2020,4,,Acta neuropsychiatrica,1601-5215 (Electronic),32,2,72-83,Corfitsen HT and Krantz B and Larsen A and Drago A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31619305/,eng,,England,"OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotics often induce excessive weight gain. We hypothesised that individuals with genetic variations related to known obesity-risk genes have an increased risk of excessive antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). This hypothesis was tested in a subset of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial data set. METHODS: The CATIE trial compared effects and side effects of five different antipsychotics through an 18-month period. Based on the maximum weight gain recorded, excessive weight gain was defined as >7% weight gain. Cytoscape and GeneMANIA were instrumental in composing a molecular pathway from eight selected genes linked to obesity. Genetic information on a total of 495.172 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available from 765 (556 males) individuals. Enrichment test was conducted through ReactomePA and Bioconductor. A permutation test was performed, testing the generated pathway against 105 permutated pathways (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, a standard genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed. RESULT: GWAS analysis did not detect significant differences related to excessive weight gain. The pathway generated contained 28 genes. A total of 2067 SNPs were significantly expressed (p < 0.01) within this pathway when comparing excessive weight gainers to the rest of the sample. Affected genes including PPARG and PCSK1 were not previously related to treatment-induced weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular pathway composed from high-risk obesity genes was shown to overlap with genetics of patients who gained >7% weight gain during the CATIE trial. This suggests that genes related to obesity compose a pathway of increased risk of excessive AIWG. Further independent analyses are warranted that may confirm or clarify the possible reasoning behind.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1017/neu.2019.41,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Female;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Obesity/*genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Risk;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Weight Gain/*drug effects/*genetics;Obesity;Antipsychotic Agents;Weight Gain",31619305,

However, recently three postulated disposition genes for schizophrenia have been increasingly better confirmed: dysbindin, neuregulin-1, and G(72)/DAOA genes. These genes code proteins involved in processes ranging from brain development to the maintenance of glutamatergic transmission in the mature brain. Current interpretation of neuroanatomical findings points at reminiscences of disturbed brain development and a loss of nonneuronal elements, the so-called neuropil, as a correlate of brain atrophy. This reduction in neuropil is mainly caused by synaptic elements. Biochemical findings supporting this show that besides the dopaminergic and serotonergic system, glutamatergic transmission is also disturbed in schizophrenia. All these findings fit very well with the presumed functions of the disposition genes. Hypothesis-free approaches in structural brain imaging and the combination of functional imaging with relevant gene variants open new avenues for using markers from brain imaging to improve the diagnosis of schizophrenia and judge the response to neuroleptic treatment. Despite the enormous increase in knowledge for example in genetic research, the risk variants known until now provide no contribution to early diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, pharmacogenetics is currently unable to give a clear answer as to whether a single patient is responding to treatment or not.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",10.1007/s00115-006-2197-5,"Animals;Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism;Brain/pathology/physiopathology;Carrier Proteins/*genetics;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease Models, Animal;Dopamine/physiology;Dysbindin;Dystrophin-Associated Proteins;Glutamine/physiology;Humans;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics;Neuregulin-1;Neurons/pathology;Neuropil/pathology;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology;Synaptic Transmission/physiology;Schizophrenia",17072567,

Antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia: a review.,2015,6,,British medical bulletin,1471-8391 (Electronic),114,1,169-79,Lally J and MacCabe JH,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25957394/,eng,,England,"INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotic medications are mainstays in the treatment of schizophrenia and a range of other psychotic disorders. SOURCES OF DATA: Recent meta-analyses of antipsychotic efficacy and tolerability have been included in this review, along with key papers on antipsychotic use in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The heterogeneity in terms of individuals' response to antipsychotic treatment and the current inability to predict response leads to a trial-and-error strategy with treatment choice. Clozapine is the only effective medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: There are a significant number of side effects associated with antipsychotic use. With a reduction in the frequency of extrapyramidal side effects with the use of second-generation antipsychotics, there has been a significant shift in the side effect burden, with an increase in the risk of cardiometabolic dysfunction. GROWING POINTS: There exist small and robust efficacy differences between medications (other than clozapine), and response and tolerability to each antipsychotic drug vary, with there being no first-line antipsychotic drug that is suitable for all patients. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: A focus on the different symptom domains of schizophrenia may lead to endophenotypic markers being identified, e.g. for negative symptoms and cognitive deficits (as well as for positive symptoms) that can promote the development of novel therapeutics, which will rationally target cellular and molecular targets, rather than just the dopamine 2 receptor. Future developments will target additional processes, including glutamatergic, cholinergic and cannabinoid receptor targets and will utilize personalized medicine techniques, such as pharmacogenetic variants and biomarkers allowing for a tailored and safer use of antipsychotics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review,preclinical model",10.1093/bmb/ldv017,Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced;Clozapine/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Drug Administration Schedule;Drug Resistance;Drug Substitution;Humans;Medication Adherence;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Schizophrenia;Antipsychotic Agents,25957394,

Recently, the glutamate hypothesis and the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis have been proposed as new pathological hypotheses for SCZ. Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive novel method that enables us to investigate the cortical activity in humans, and this modality is a suitable approach to evaluate these hypotheses. In this study, we systematically reviewed TMS-EEG studies that investigated the cortical dysfunction of SCZ to examine the emerging hypotheses for SCZ. The following search terms were set in this systematic review: (TMS or 'transcranial magnetic stimulation') and (EEG or electroencephalog*) and (schizophrenia). We inspected the articles written in English that examined humans and were published by March 2020 via MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. The initial search generated 379 studies, and 14 articles were finally identified. The current review noted that patients with SCZ demonstrated the E/I deficits in the prefrontal cortex, whose dysfunctions were also associated with cognitive impairment and clinical severity. Moreover, TMS-induced gamma activity in the prefrontal cortex was related to positive symptoms, while theta/delta band activities were associated with negative symptoms in SCZ. Thus, this systematic review discusses aspects of the pathophysiological neural basis of SCZ that are not explained by the traditional dopamine hypothesis exclusively, based on the findings of previous TMS-EEG research, mainly in terms of the E/I imbalance hypothesis. In conclusion, TMS-EEG neurophysiology can be applied to establish objective biomarkers for better diagnosis as well as to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with SCZ.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3390/jpm11050388,Schizophrenia;Electroencephalography,34068580,PMC8150818

A semi-Markovian model was developed to simulate the progress of a cohort of adult men and women who received clozapine as a third-line antipsychotic medication. We compared current practices using two genotype-guided strategies: (1) HLA genotyping followed by clozapine, with ANCM only for patients who tested positive for one or both alleles (genotype-guided blood sampling); (2) HLA genotyping followed by clozapine for low-risk patients and alternative antipsychotics for patients who tested positive (clozapine substitution scheme). Up to a decision threshold of $3.9 million per quality-adjusted life-year (90-fold the US gross domestic product per capita), the base-case results indicate that compared with current ANCM, genotype-guided blood sampling prior to clozapine initiation appeared cost-effective for targeted blood monitoring only in patients with HLA susceptibility alleles.

The use of anticonvulsants was associated with Gln increase but did not affect Glu or Glu/Gln. Neither lithium nor antipsychotic use influenced metabolite levels.

Genetic variation in the serotonin system might modulate bone metabolism changes during SRI treatment. In a clinical trial we examined functional genetic polymorphisms of serotonin transporter and receptors involved in bone metabolism to determine whether they predict changes in bone metabolism during SRI treatment. METHODS: In 69 adults (age ≥ 60) participating in a 12-week, open-label trial of the SRI venlafaxine for major depression, serum markers of bone formation (P1NP) and resorption (β-CTX) were assayed before and after treatment. Participants were genotyped for putative high- versus low-expressing polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter (5HTTLPR) and 1B receptor (HTR1B) genes. RESULTS: Bone formation was significantly reduced with administration of venlafaxine in participants with the high-expressing 5HTTLPR genotype and those with the low-expressing HTR1B genotype. This primarily occurred in individuals with the combination of the high-expressing 5HTTLPR genotype and the low-expressing HTR1B genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that genetic variation in the serotonin receptors predicts changes in bone metabolism during SRI use.

As a first step, plasma metabolites were assayed using samples from the 803 patients in the PGRN-AMPS SSRI MDD trial. The metabolomics data were then used to ""inform"" genomics by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma concentrations of the metabolite most highly associated with clinical response, serotonin (5-HT). Two genome-wide or near genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signals were identified, one that mapped near the TSPAN5 gene and another across the ERICH3 gene, both genes that are highly expressed in the brain. Knocking down TSPAN5 and ERICH3 resulted in decreased 5-HT concentrations in neuroblastoma cell culture media and decreased expression of enzymes involved in 5-HT biosynthesis and metabolism. Functional genomic studies demonstrated that ERICH3 was involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle formation and TSPAN5 was an ethanol-responsive gene that may be a marker for response to acamprosate pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder (AUD), a neuropsychiatric disorder highly co-morbid with MDD. In parallel studies, kynurenine was the plasma metabolite most highly associated with MDD symptom severity and application of a metabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics approach identified DEFB1 and AHR as genes associated with variation in plasma kynurenine levels. Both genes also contributed to kynurenine-related inflammatory pathways. Finally, a multiply replicated predictive algorithm for SSRI clinical response with a balanced predictive accuracy of 76% (compared with 56% for clinical data alone) was developed by including the SNPs in TSPAN5, ERICH3, DEFB1 and AHR. In summary, application of a multiple omics research strategy that used metabolomics to inform genomics, followed by functional genomic studies, identified novel genes that influenced monoamine biology and made it possible to develop a predictive algorithm for SSRI clinical outcomes in MDD. A similar pharmaco-omic research strategy might be broadly applicable for the study of other neuropsychiatric diseases and their drug therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3389/fphar.2020.614048,Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors,33510640,PMC7836019
Genetic predictors of antipsychotic response to lurasidone identified in a genome wide association study and by schizophrenia risk genes.,2018,2,,Schizophrenia research,1573-2509 (Electronic),192,,194-204,Li J and Yoshikawa A and Brennan MD and Ramsey TL and Meltzer HY,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28431800/,eng,,Netherlands,"Biomarkers which predict response to atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) increases their benefit/risk ratio. We sought to identify common variants in genes which predict response to lurasidone, an AAPD, by associating genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and changes (Δ) in Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores from two 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled trials of lurasidone in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. We also included SCZ risk SNPs identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium using a polygenic risk analysis. The top genomic loci, with uncorrected p<10(-4), include: 1) synaptic adhesion (PTPRD, LRRC4C, NRXN1, ILIRAPL1, SLITRK1) and scaffolding (MAGI1, MAGI2, NBEA) genes, both essential for synaptic function; 2) other synaptic plasticity-related genes (NRG1/3 and KALRN); 3) the neuron-specific RNA splicing regulator, RBFOX1; and 4) ion channel genes, e.g. KCNA10, KCNAB1, KCNK9 and CACNA2D3). Some genes predicted response for patients with both European and African Ancestries. We replicated some SNPs reported to predict response to other atypical APDs in other GWAS. Although none of the biomarkers reached genome-wide significance, many of the genes and associated pathways have previously been linked to SCZ. Two polygenic modeling approaches, GCTA-GREML and PLINK-Polygenic Risk Score, demonstrated that some risk genes related to neurodevelopment, synaptic biology, immune response, and histones, also contributed to prediction of response. The top hits predicting response to lurasidone did not predict improvement with placebo. This is the first evidence from clinical trials that SCZ risk SNPs are related to clinical response to an AAPD. These results need to be replicated in an independent sample.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: duplicate",10.1016/j.schres.2017.04.009,Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics;Double-Blind Method;Female;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Ion Channels/genetics;Lurasidone Hydrochloride/*therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;Multifactorial Inheritance/genetics;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics;Pharmacogenomic Variants/*genetics;Principal Component Analysis;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;RNA Splicing Factors/genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenia;Genome,28431800,

Age, gender, baseline weight and AP response using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were assessed. Multivariate regression models for AP-induced weight gain and TD, based on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were constructed. RESULTS: African-American ethnicity (self-report, p = 0.021 and Structure analysis, p = 0.042) predicted AP-induced weight gain but not TD (self-report, p = 0.408 and Structure analysis, p = 0.714). CONCLUSION: Self-reported African-American ethnicity seemed to better predict AP-induced weight gain in schizophrenia compared with genetic ancestry, suggesting a possible role of environmental in addition to genetic factors.

Genetically Predicted Brain C4A Expression Is Associated With TSPO and Hippocampal Morphology.,2021,11,1,Biological psychiatry,1873-2402 (Electronic),90,9,652-660,Da Silva T and Guma E and Hafizi S and Koppel A and Rusjan P and Kennedy JL and Chakravarty MM and Mizrahi R,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34456009/,eng,,United States,"BACKGROUND: Alterations in the immune system, particularly C4A, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. C4A promotes synapse elimination by microglia in preclinical models; however, it is unknown whether this process is also present in living humans and how it affects brain morphology. METHODS: Participants (N = 111; 33 patients with psychosis, 37 individuals at clinical high risk, and 41 healthy control subjects) underwent a TSPO [(18)F]FEPPA positron emission tomography scan and a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Brain C4A expression was genetically predicted as a function of the dosage of each of 4 structural elements (C4AL, C4BL, C4AS, C4BS). RESULTS: Higher genetically predicted brain C4A expression was associated with higher brain microglial marker (TSPO) and altered hippocampal morphology, including reduced surface area and medial displacement in the CA1 area. This study is the first to quantify genetically predicted brain C4A expression in individuals at clinical high risk, showing significantly lower C4A in individuals at clinical high risk compared with healthy control subjects. We also showed a robust effect of sex on genetically predicted brain C4A expression and effects of both sex and cannabis use on brain TSPO. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time complement system (C4A) coupling with a microglial marker (TSPO) and hippocampal morphology in living human brain. These findings pave the way for future research on the interaction between C4A and glial cell function, which has the potential to inform the disease mechanism underlying psychosis and schizophrenia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.biopsych.2021.06.021,"Brain/diagnostic imaging/metabolism;Hippocampus/diagnostic imaging/metabolism;Humans;Microglia/metabolism;Positron-Emission Tomography;*Psychotic Disorders;Pyridines;*Receptors, GABA/genetics/metabolism;Brain",34456009,

Melanocortin4 receptor (MC4R) gene, one of the candidate genes for AIMD, has been under-studied in the Chinese patients. We conducted a pharmacogenetic study in a large cohort of Chinese patients with schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated the genetic variation of MC4R in Chinese population by genotyping two SNPs (rs489693 and rs17782313) in 1,991 Chinese patients and examined association of these variants with the metabolic effects that were often observed to be related to AIMD. Metabolic measures, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were assessed at baseline and after 6-week antipsychotic treatment. We found that interaction of SNP×medication status (drug-naïve/medicated) was significantly associated with BMI, WC, and HDL change %, respectively. Both SNPs were significantly associated with baseline BMI and WC in the medicated group. Moderate association of rs489693 with WC, Triglyceride, and HDL change % were observed in the whole sample. In the drug-naïve group, we found recessive effects of rs489693 on BMI gain more than 7%, WC and Triglyceride change %, with AA incurring more metabolic adverse effects. In conclusion, the association between rs489693 and the metabolic measures is ubiquitous but moderate. Rs17782313 is less involved in AIMD.

Evidence is emerging of genetic risk factors. The HTR2C gene is an essential candidate in pharmacogenetic studies of antipsychotic-induced metabolic effects. Nevertheless, there were inconsistent results among studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between -759C/T, functional polymorphism of the HTR2C gene and metabolic adverse effects in Thai psychiatric patients treated with risperidone monotherapy. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, 108 psychiatric patients treated with risperidone monotherapy for ≥3 months were recruited. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests were obtained upon enrollment and history of treatment was reviewed from medical records. Weight gain was defined as an increase ≥7% of baseline weight. Metabolic syndrome was evaluated according to the 2005 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Asia criteria. The -759C/T, polymorphism was genotyped. The associations between -759C/T polymorphism and metabolic side effects were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used for determining potential confounders. RESULTS: Neither weight gain nor metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with -759C/T allelic and genotype variants of HTR2C. However, T allele of -759C/T polymorphism significantly associated with the hypertension. This association was not affected by possible confounding factors such as gender, risperidone dose, duration of treatment and family history of hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that psychiatric patients with T allele of -759C/T polymorphism may be at higher risk for hypertension.

An economic model of the cost-utility of pre-emptive genetic testing to support pharmacotherapy in patients with major depression in primary care.,2019,10,,The pharmacogenomics journal,1473-1150 (Electronic),19,5,480-489,Sluiter RL and Janzing JGE and van der Wilt GJ and Kievit W and Teichert M,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30647446/,eng,,United States,"The pharmacokinetics of many antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI)) are influenced by the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. Therefore, pharmacogenetics could play an important role in the treatment of depressive patients. The potential cost-utility of screening patients is however still unknown. Therefore, a Markov model was developed to compare the strategy of screening for CYP2D6 and subsequently adjust antidepressant treatment according to a patient's metabolizer profile of poor, extensive, or ultra metabolizer, with the strategy of no screening ('one size fits all' principle). Each week a patient had a probability of side effects, which was followed by dosage titration or treatment switching. After 6 weeks treatment effect was evaluated followed by treatment adjustments if necessary, with a total time horizon of the model of 12 weeks. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective. The strategy of screening compared with no screening resulted in incremental costs of €91 (95 percentiles: €39; €152) more expensive but also more effect with 0.001 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) (95 percentiles: 0.001; 0.002) gain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was therefore €77,406 per QALY gained, but varied between €22,500 and €377,500 depending on the price of screening and productivity losses. According to our model, we cannot unequivocally conclude that screening for CYP2D6 in primary care patients using antidepressants is be cost-effective, as the results are surrounded by large uncertainty. Therefore, information from ongoing studies should be used to reduce these uncertainties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1038/s41397-019-0070-8,"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;*Cost-Benefit Analysis;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Genetic Testing/*economics;Humans;Markov Chains;*Models, Economic;Primary Health Care;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Models, Economic",30647446,

Haloperidol therapy poses a high risk of adverse drug reactions (ADR). Contradictory data, which include the effects of genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the elements of haloperidol biotransformation system on haloperidol metabolism rate and plasma drug concentration ratio, are described in patients with different genotypes. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms on haloperidol equilibrium concentration in patients with alcohol use disorder. METHODS: The study included 69 male patients with alcohol use disorder. Genotyping was performed using the allele-specific real-time PCR. CYP2D6 and CYP3A were phenotyped with HPLC-MS using the concentration of endogenous substrate of the enzyme and its urinary metabolites [6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline(6-HO-THBC) to pinoline ratio for CYP2D6 and 6-β-hydroxycortisol to cortisol ratio for CYP3A]. The equilibrium plasma concentration was determined using LC-MS-MS. RESULTS: Results indicated that both C/D indexes and equilibrium concentration levels depend on CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism, but only in patients receiving haloperidol intramuscular injections [0.26 (0.09; 0.48) vs. 0.54 (0.44; 0.74), p=0.037].

In a number of double-blind controlled studies, citalopram was compared to placebo and to known tricyclic antidepressants. These studies have shown their efficacy and good safety. The inefficacy of a psychotropic treatment in at least 20% of depressives has led a number of authors to propose original drug combinations and associations, like antidepressant/lithium (Li), antidepressant/sleep deprivation (agrypnia), antidepressant/ECT, or antidepressant/LT3. The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a combined citalopram/lithium treatment in therapy-resistant patients, taking account of serotonergic functions, as tested by the fenfluramine/prolactin test, and of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of metabolism. DESIGN OF THE STUDY: A washout period of 3 days before initiating the treatment is included. After an open treatment phase of 28 days (D) with citalopram (20 mg D1-D3; 40 mg D4-D14; 40 or 60 mg D15-D28; concomitant medication allowed: chloral, chlorazepate), the nonresponding patients [less than 50% improvement in the total score on the 21 item-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)] are selected and treated with or without Li (randomized in double-blind conditions: citalopram/Li or citalopram/placebo) during the treatment (D29-D35). Thereafter, all patients included in the double-blind phase subsequently receive an open treatment with citalopram/Li for 7 days (D36-D42). The hypothesis of a relationship between serotoninergic functions in patients using the fenfluramine/prolactin test (D1) and the clinical response to citalopram (and Li) is assessed. Moreover, it is evaluated whether the pharmacogenetic status of the patients, as determined by the mephenytoin/dextromethorphan test (D0-D28), is related to the metabolism of fenfluramine and citalopram, and also to the clinical response. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT: Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorders according to DSM III are submitted to a clinical assessment of D1, D7, D14, D28, D35, D42: HDRS, CGI (clinical global impression), VAS (visual analog scales for self-rating of depression), HDRS (Hamilton depression rating scale, 21 items), UKU (side effects scale), and to clinical laboratory examens, as well as ECG, control of weight, pulse, blood pressure at D1, D28, D35. Fenfluramine/prolactin test: A butterfly needle is inserted in a forearm vein at 7 h 45 and is kept patent with liquemine. Samples for plasma prolactin, and d- and l-fenfluramine determinations are drawn at 8 h 15 (base line). Patients are given 60 mg fenfluramine (as a racemate) at 8 h 30. Kinetic points are determined at 9 h 30, 10 h 30, 11 h 30, 12 h 30, 13 h 30. Plasma levels of d- and l-fenfluramine are determined by gas chromatography and prolactin by IRNA. Mephenytoin/dextromethorphan test: Patients empty their bladders before the test; they are then given 25 mg dextropethorphan and 100 mg mephenytoin (as a racemate) at 8 h 00. They collect all urines during the following 8 hours. The metabolic ratio is determined by gas chromatography (metabolic ratio dextromethorphan/dextrorphan greater than 0.3 = PM (poor metabolizer); mephenytoin/4-OH-mephenytoin greater than 5.6, or mephenytoin S/R greater than 0.8 = PM). Citalopram plasma levels: Plasma levels of citalopram, desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are determined by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY.

We determined the metabolic status of CYP2C19 based on the combination of *1, *2, *3 and *17 alleles extracted from genome-wide data in 1239 patients with MDD, pharmacologically treated in a naturalistic setting.

We tested if symptom improvement, response and side effects were associated with CYP2C19 metabolic status adjusting for potential confounders. We considered patients treated with drugs for depression having CYP2C19 genotyping recommended by guidelines (T1 Drugs); secondarily, with all psychotropic drugs having CYP2C19 as relevant metabolic path (T2 Drugs). In the group treated with T1 drugs (n = 540), poor metabolizers (PMs) showed higher response and higher symptom improvement compared to normal metabolizers (p = 0.023 and p = 0.009, respectively), but also higher risk of autonomic and neurological side effects (p = 0.022 and p = 0.022 respectively). In patients treated with T2 drugs (n = 801), similar results were found. No associations between metabolizer status and other types of side effects were found (psychic and other side effects).

The type of antipsychotic medication and particular genetic variants of the dopaminergic system might be associated with remission. Potential pharmacogenetic markers of the treatment response to antipsychotic medication are missing. This study assessed the possible association between dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2 rs1800497) and dopamine transporter (DAT1 rs28363170) gene variants with symptomatic remission in schizophrenia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) monotherapy was administered for 6 months to 150 male Caucasian subjects with schizophrenia. Remission was evaluated according to ""Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group"" criteria. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Symptomatic remission was found in 31% of patients. DRD2 rs1800497 and DAT1 rs28363170 gene variants were not significantly associated with symptomatic remission. The limitations are a relatively small sample size of patients with schizophrenia (N=150), especially of group with symptomatic remission (N=45). However, the study had moderate but adequate sample sizes for most of the comparisons. Only two dopaminergic polymorphisms were analyzed, and plasma concentration of olanzapine was not determined. CONCLUSION: These results revealed a lack of association between DRD2 rs1800497 and DAT1 rs28363170 genetic variants and symptomatic remission in male patients treated with olanzapine, suggesting that these genetic variants could not be used to predict symptomatic remission to olanzapine monotherapy.

CYP1A2, an inducible gene of the cytochrome P450 family of genes, has been suggested to contribute to the metabolism of typical antipsychotics in subjects with schizophrenia on long-term treatment, and has been considered as a potential candidate gene for development of TD. In this study, we have investigated the significance of CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms in TD susceptibility among chronic schizophrenia sufferers (n=335) from north India. TD was diagnosed in approximately 29% (96/335) of these subjects. Of the 96 TD positives, 28 had been treated with typical antipsychotics alone, 23 with atypical antipsychotics alone and 45 patients had received both classes of drugs during the course of their illness. Out of the six SNPs tested, CYP1A2(*)2, (*)4, (*)5, (*)6 were found to be monomorphic in our population. CYP1A2(*)1C and CYP1A2(*)1F were polymorphic and were analyzed in the study sample. Since these two allelic variants lead to lesser inducibility among smokers, the smoking status of TD patients was also considered for all subsequent analysis. We observed increased severity of TD among TD-Y smokers, who were carriers of CYP1A2(*)1C (G>A) variant allele and had received only typical antipsychotic drugs (F(1,8)=9.203, P=0.016). No significant association of CYP1A2(*)1F with TD was observed irrespective of the class of drug they received or their smoking status.

To follow-up on this preliminary finding, an extended linkage analysis was performed which employed thirteen microsatellite markers, spanning a total distance of 85 cM on 14q. Effectively, P-values <0.05 were observed for a region extending over 41.88 cM, with the marker D14S281 displaying a peak multipoint non-parametric lod (NPL) score of 2.72 and an associated P-value of 0.003. Support for this finding was also obtained from flanking markers indicating excess allele sharing at 14q22-24 in Irish bipolar sib-pairs. A web-based candidate gene search of 14q22-24 resulted in the selection of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCHI), located 200 kb 3' of D14S281, as the best plausible candidate gene for involvement in BPD. GCHI is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), a natural cofactor for tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases. These enzymes play an essential role in the biosynthesis of various hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and serotonin. Numerous studies have also suggested that the clinical symptoms of depression might be related to a deficiency of BH(4). An association study between BPD and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GCHI (G to A at position -959 bp, upstream of the ATG codon), is also presented here. This study revealed that the variant A allele is preferentially transmitted to BPI probands (chi(2) = 4.54, P = 0.033) suggesting that variants within GCHI may contribute to BPD in the Irish population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1002/ajmg.b.30192,"Alleles;Bipolar Disorder/enzymology/*genetics;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics;DNA/chemistry/genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;Family Health;GTP Cyclohydrolase/*genetics;*Genetic Linkage;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Ireland;Linkage Disequilibrium;Microsatellite Repeats;Mutation;Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Bipolar Disorder",15909293,

Further, polypharmacy is common in the treatment of psychotic disorders due to insufficient treatment effect during monotherapy. As a potential circuit problem, we hypothesized that antipsychotic polypharmacy is associated with increased risk of nonadherence. To investigate this, in terms of 'complete' nonadherence, the rates of undetectable serum drug concentrations during prescribing of doses used in psychotic disorders were compared during antipsychotic 'monotherapy' vs 'polypharmacy' treatment using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data of 24,239 patients. A complete nonadherence patient was objectively defined as the detection of at least one event of undetectable serum concentration of a prescribed antipsychotic drug. The rate of complete nonadherence patients was compared between antipsychotic monotherapy and polypharmacy by multivariate logistic regression analyses. The overall rate of complete nonadherence in the population was 6.8% (n = 1,644; 95%CI: 6.5-7.1). Compared to monotherapy patients, the rate of nonadherence increased significantly with the number of co-prescribed antipsychotic drugs. After adjusting for sex (p = 0.091) and age (p < 0.001) as covariates, the rates of nonadherence vs monotherapy were 1.69-fold (95% CI: 1.48-1.92; p < 0.001) for two, 2.60-fold (95% CI: 1.88-3.59; p < 0.001) for three, and 3.54-fold (95% CI: 1.46-8.58; p = 0.005) for four or more co-prescribed antipsychotics, respectively. The present naturalistic study shows that antipsychotic polypharmacy significantly increases the rate of complete nonadherence, which is positively correlated with increasing number of concurrently used antipsychotic drugs. Thus, the intended clinical benefit of combining oral antipsychotic drugs may probably be reduced by increased nonadherence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.06.007,"Administration, Oral;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage/*blood;Chromatography, Liquid/methods;Drug Monitoring/*methods;Female;Humans;Male;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Medication Adherence/*psychology;Middle Aged;Norway/epidemiology;*Polypharmacy;Schizophrenia/blood/drug therapy;Schizophrenic Psychology;Young Adult;Antipsychotic Agents;Polypharmacy",32595082,

To this end, spliceome-profiling is a new methodological approach that has considerable conceptual relevance for discovery and clinical translation of novel biomarkers for psychiatric illnesses. Advances in microarray technology now allow for improved sensitivity in measuring the transcriptome while simultaneously querying the ""exome"" (all exons) and ""spliceome"" (all alternatively spliced variants). The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of spliceome-profiling to discern transcriptomic biomarkers of psychosis. METHODS: We measured exome and spliceome expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 schizophrenia patients, nine bipolar disorder patients, and eight healthy control subjects. Each diagnostic group was compared to each other, and the combined group of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients was also compared to the control group. Furthermore, we compared subjects with a history of psychosis to subjects without such history. RESULTS: After applying Bonferroni corrections for the 21,866 full-length gene transcripts analyzed, we found significant interactions between diagnostic group and exon identity, consistent with group differences in rates or types of alternative splicing. Relative to the control group, 18 genes in the bipolar disorder group, eight genes in the schizophrenia group, and 15 genes in the combined bipolar disorder and schizophrenia group appeared differentially spliced. Importantly, thirty-three genes showed differential splicing patterns between the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia groups. More frequent exon inclusion and/or over-expression was observed in psychosis. Finally, these observations are reconciled with an analysis of the ontologies, the pathways and the protein domains significantly over-represented among the alternatively spliced genes, several of which support prior discoveries. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first blood-based spliceome-profiling study of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to be reported. The battery of alternatively spliced genes and exons identified in this discovery-oriented exploratory study, if replicated, may have potential utility to discern the molecular subtypes of psychosis. Spliceome-profiling, as a new methodological approach in transcriptomics, warrants further work to evaluate its utility in personalized medicine. Potentially, this approach could also permit the future development of tissue-sampling methodologies in a form that is more acceptable to patients and thereby allow monitoring of dynamic and time-dependent plasticity in disease severity and response to therapeutic interventions in clinical psychiatry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.2174/1875692110907030164,"Bipolar Disorder;DNA, Recombinant;Schizophrenia;Psychotic Disorders",21532980,PMC3083864

Recent reports indicate that venlafaxine may put the elderly at increased risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular adverse events. We investigated the relationship between the CYP2D6 polymorphism and steady-state plasma concentration of venlafaxine (VEN) and its primary metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) in elderly participants receiving venlafaxine-XR for major depression in order to explore the contribution of pharmacogenetics to medication tolerability. METHODS: Forty-six elderly participants received venlafaxine-XR for the treatment of major depression. CYP2D6 genotype and steady-state plasma levels of VEN and ODV were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of participants were homozygous of the wild type (WT) allele, whereas 35% carried one or more variant alleles associated with intermediate and poor 2D6 metabolizer status. VEN concentration per unit dose was significantly higher and ODV concentration per unit dose was significantly lower in participants who carried one or more variant alleles compared to participants who were homozygous for the WT allele. The VEN and ODV concentrations per unit dose were also correlated with creatinine clearance. CYP2D6 genotype was not associated with medication associated side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma dose-corrected concentrations of VEN and ODV correlated with genetically determined CYP2D6 enzymatic activity in depressed elders treated with venlafaxine-XR. This relationship was not masked by the effects of age-related illness or polypharmacy. Future clinical application of pharmacogenetics to examine 2D6-dependent medications may help reduce the incidence of medication adverse events particularly in those elders at higher risk for medication adverse events due to impaired renal or cardiac function.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1002/gps.1522,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects/*blood/therapeutic use;Creatinine/metabolism;Cyclohexanols/adverse effects/*blood/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/*genetics;Desvenlafaxine Succinate;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Venlafaxine Hydrochloride;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6",16642541,

However, the effect of G-350A GNβ3 genetic polymorphism and therapeutic outcome of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in MDD has not yet been studied. METHOD: One hundred newly diagnosed MDD patients were treated with sertraline for 6 weeks. The severity of depressive symptoms was weekly assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). A 50% decrease in HRSD was defined as response to treatment. GNβ3 polymorphisms (G-350A, A657T) were determined in each individual using a PCR-RFLP technique. RESULTS: Our results suggested that subjects with GG genotype of G-350A responded 5.9-folds more to sertraline compared to carriers of other variants (P = 0.004, OR = 5.9; 95% CI = 1.66-21.99). In addition, carriers of the G allele responded 1.9-folds more to sertraline than carriers of the A allele (P = 0.032, OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.05-3.65). However, no association was observed between A657T variants and response to sertraline (P = 0.920, OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.31-2.69). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that G-350A variant of GNβ3 plays a foremost part as a predictor of response to antidepressant treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00228-018-2577-3,"Adult;Alleles;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Genotype;Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics;Humans;Male;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use;Sertraline/*therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Sertraline",30324302,

The detection of individual genetic differences in response to medication may lead to important new strategies for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. With the advent of molecular biology individual differences can be determined on the molecular level. The awareness of the importance of pharmacogenetic factors has recently led to numerous studies seeking association between genetic variants and treatment-outcome. The results however, are partially inconsistent. One of the main reasons for this inconsistency may be accounted by heterogeneity of study designs.

Polysubstance-induced relapse of schizoaffective disorder refractory to high-dose antipsychotic medications: a case report.,2016,9,6,Journal of medical case reports,1752-1947 (Electronic),10,1,242,Tucker MG and Kekulawala S and Kent M and Mostafa S and Harvey R,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27599617/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of comorbid illicit drug use in persons with chronic psychotic illness represents a strong determinant of psychotic relapse and rehospitalization. Epidemiological studies indicate changing patterns of illicit drug use in Australia, which are concerning because of increased use of crystal methamphetamine, also known as ""ice."" An important complication of habitual use of crystal methamphetamine is the development of a dose-dependent acute psychotic reaction. We report a case of an acute psychotic relapse in response to polydrug use most notable for multiple recent binges of crystal methamphetamine. Unlike previously described case reports, our patient's acute psychosis was refractory to ultra-high doses of multiple antipsychotic medications. This presented safety challenges due to the risk of serious side effects with high-dose antipsychotic medications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old white man with a past history of schizoaffective disorder was brought to our emergency department by the police in a state of extreme agitation, combativeness, and paranoia after use of cannabis and crystal methamphetamine. Despite existing compliance with zuclopenthixol decanoate depot medication, he required multiple emergency injections of zuclopenthixol acetate, and regular high-dose droperidol, chlorpromazine, and lorazepam. However, he remained severely agitated and psychotic with continuous threats of harm to others. A test of antipsychotic drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes did not reveal a pharmacogenetic cause for the poor therapeutic efficacy of antipsychotic medications. His psychosis did not appear to be modified by psychoactive medications but was instead self-limited to the presence of endogenous methamphetamine within his system. He fully recovered 96 to 120 hours post-presentation and was discharged home with out-patient clinic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current case highlights the challenging nature of a severe psychotic relapse precipitated by illicit substances that is resistant to medical management. High doses of multiple antipsychotic medications may be required to manage dangerous behaviors associated with these acute psychotic relapses. These patients require close monitoring for adverse effects with adjustment of dosing to ensure the optimal balance of risk versus benefit while the patient is acutely psychotic. The results are of relevance for the management of psychiatric emergencies in emergency departments and acute mental health settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: case report",10.1186/s13256-016-1031-3,Adult;Amphetamine-Related Disorders/*complications/drug           therapy/physiopathology/psychology;Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage;Chlorpromazine/administration & dosage;Clopenthixol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives;Droperidol/administration & dosage;Drug Administration Schedule;*Emergency Medical Services;Humans;Hypnotics and Sedatives/*administration & dosage;Lorazepam/administration & dosage;Male;Marijuana Abuse/*complications/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology;Methamphetamine/*adverse effects;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology;Time Factors;Treatment Outcome;Violence/*psychology;Antipsychotic Agents;Recurrence;Psychotic Disorders,27599617,PMC5011982

Sialorrhea is one such effect, which can be distressing for many patients. Studies on the pharmacogenetics of the adverse effects of clozapine are limited. The aim of the present study was to determine whether clozapine-induced sialorrhea is associated with a 120 base-pairs (bp) tandem duplication polymorphism in the dopamine receptor subtype D4 (DRD4) gene. Ninety-five patients, mean age 35.43±9.43 years, with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and on clozapine were included in the study. Development of sialorrhea in response to the drug, as manifested by drooling of saliva, was documented in 45 (47.4%) patients. Genotyping of the patients was carried out to detect the presence of the polymorphism of interest. Clozapine-induced sialorrhea was found to be associated significantly with the 120-bp duplication in DRD4. The association was found to fit a log-additive model with an odds ratio of 2.95 (95% confidence interval 1.51-5.75; P=0.0006). Thus, the presence of the 120-bp duplication in DRD4 appears to confer a risk for sialorrhea in response to clozapine therapy.

Further, supporting AKT1's role in transducing hippocampal neuroplasticity and dopaminergic processes, we found epistasis with functional polymorphisms in BDNF and COMT--genes also implicated in MTL biology related to AKT1. Consistent with prior predictions that these biologic processes relate to schizophrenia, we found epistasis between the same AKT1, BDNF and COMT functional variants on schizophrenia risk, and pharmacogenetic interactions of AKT1 with the effects on cognition and brain volume measures by AKT1 activators in common clinical use--lithium and sodium valproate. Our findings suggest that AKT1 affects risk for schizophrenia and accompanying cognitive deficits, at least in part through specific genetic interactions related to brain neuroplasticity and development, and that these AKT1 effects may be pharmacologically modulated in patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/mp.2011.91,"Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Brain Mapping;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics;Cognition Disorders/drug therapy/etiology;Economics, Pharmaceutical;Epistasis, Genetic/drug effects/genetics;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Memory Disorders/drug therapy/etiology/genetics;Neuropsychological Tests;Oxygen/blood;Photic Stimulation;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics;Reaction Time/drug effects/genetics;Schizophrenia/complications/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology;Temporal Lobe/blood supply/drug effects/*pathology;Humanities;Humanism;Temporal Lobe;Pharmacogenetics",21788944,PMC3449232

We aimed to synthesize the literature examining the association between the clinically most relevant inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) and cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with BD. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and PsychInfo were systematically searched for all relevant English language articles published prior to April 2017. Articles were included if they examined the association between CRP and cardiovascular risk factors/disease in BD. RESULTS: Fifteen relevant articles were retrieved. Studies were mostly cross-sectional and heterogeneous in the cardiovascular risk factors investigated. Overall, elevated CRP was associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome, elevated body mass index, higher waist circumference, and obesity. CRP was inconsistently associated with elevated fasting glucose, insulin levels, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Atypical antipsychotic use may mediate some of these effects. No study examined CRP's association with actual cardiovascular disease (e.g. coronary artery disease) in BD. CONCLUSIONS: In BD, CRP is associated with increases in several cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that systemic inflammation could be a shared driving force for both outcomes of BD and cardiovascular risk. Further longitudinal research is needed in this area to verify causality, including an examination of actual cardiovascular disease. Non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments with anti-inflammatory effects should also be investigated, particularly in patients with increased CRP, for their potential to reduce cardiovascular risk in BD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2017.07.026,Bipolar Disorder/*epidemiology/*metabolism;C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism;Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/*metabolism;Humans;Inflammation/epidemiology/metabolism;Risk Factors;Bipolar Disorder;C-Reactive Protein,28764912,

After a 1-week washout period, CLZ was started at a dose of 25 mg/d, which was increased by the third week up to a maximum of 600 mg/d (mean 365.00 +/- 129.88 mg/d SD) and remained unchanged until the end of the study (week 8). The patients showed a significant improvement in the mean scores of the rating scales for positive (SAPS) and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, SANS) (P < 0.003, P < 0.02). All of the patients included in the study were BPRS responders; 65% were also SAPS and 75% SANS responders (>20% improvement). The improvement in the SANS score was significantly greater among the female patients (P < 0.05). The SAPS and SANS responders had a significantly higher mean metabolic ratio [MR = (NCLZ/CLZ)] than the nonresponders (P < 0.01), and the percentage of improvement significantly correlated with the increase in MR. This finding suggests that the individual pharmacogenetics indicated by metabolic capacity may be related to clinical response. All of the patients showed a reduction in white blood cell counts, but this was significantly less in the SANS responders than the SANS nonresponders (P = 0.047). The SAPS responders had significantly lower neutrophil counts than the nonresponders (P = 0.03).

Although genome-wide association studies of antipsychotic-induced weight gain have been performed, few genome-wide loci have been discovered. Moreover, these genome-wide association studies have included a wide variety of antipsychotic compounds. AIMS: We aim to gain more insight in the genomic loci affecting antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Given the variable pharmacological properties of antipsychotics, we hypothesized that targeting a single antipsychotic compound would provide new clues about genomic loci affecting antipsychotic-induced weight gain. METHODS: All subjects included for this genome-wide association study (n=339) were first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients treated with amisulpride and were minimally medicated (defined as antipsychotic use <2 weeks in the previous year and/or <6 weeks lifetime). Weight gain was defined as the increase in body mass index from before until approximately 1 month after amisulpride treatment. RESULTS: Our genome-wide association analyses for antipsychotic-induced weight gain yielded one genome-wide significant hit (rs78310016; β=1.05; p=3.66 × 10(-08); n=206) in a locus not previously associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain or body mass index. Minor allele carriers had an odds ratio of 3.98 (p=1.0 × 10(-03)) for clinically meaningful antipsychotic-induced weight gain (⩾7% of baseline weight). In silico analysis elucidated a chromatin interaction with 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1. In an attempt to replicate single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain, we found none were associated with amisulpride-induced weight gain. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the involvement of rs78310016 and possibly 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1 in antipsychotic-induced weight gain. In line with the unique binding profile of this atypical antipsychotic, our findings furthermore hint that biological mechanisms underlying amisulpride-induced weight gain differ from antipsychotic-induced weight gain by other atypical antipsychotics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1177/0269881120907972,"Adult;Alleles;Amisulpride/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Cohort Studies;Female;Genetic Loci;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase/genetics;Male;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy;Schizophrenia/drug therapy;Weight Gain/*drug effects/genetics;Young Adult;Weight Gain;Genome;Psychotic Disorders",32126890,PMC7222287

A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a useful tool to explore genetic liability of a complex trait such as antidepressant treatment response. Here, we review studies that use PRSs to examine genetic overlap between any trait and antidepressant treatment response in unipolar MDD. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO. Our search included studies examining associations between PRSs of psychiatric as well as non-psychiatric traits and antidepressant treatment response in patients with unipolar MDD. A quality assessment of the included studies was performed. RESULTS: In total, eleven articles were included which contained PRSs for 30 traits. Studies varied in sample size and endpoints used for antidepressant treatment response. Overall, PRSs for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the personality trait openness, coronary artery disease, obesity, and stroke have been associated with antidepressant treatment response in patients with unipolar MDD. LIMITATIONS: The endpoints used by included studies differed significantly, therefore it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between a PRS and antidepressant treatment response have been reported for a number of traits in patients with unipolar MDD.

ABCB1 protects the brain from many drugs and toxins such as glucocorticoids through the efflux pump. Recent evidence suggests that a specific allele of the ABCB1 gene confers susceptibility to major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Japanese population. The aim of this study was to explore the association of ABCB1 gene polymorphisms with MDD in a local Chinese Han population. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-two MDD patients and 208 unrelated individuals were matched by age and sex and examined using a case-control design. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ABCB1 gene, including rs1045642, rs2032583, rs2032582, rs2235040, rs1128503, and rs2235015, were genotyped by ligase detection reaction and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis were investigated in the two study groups. RESULTS: Significant protection for MDD individuals carrying the TG haplotype of rs1045642-rs2032582 was observed (odds ratio 0.470, 95% confidence interval 0.251-0.897, P=0.01). The rs2032582 (G2677T) and rs1128503 (C1236T) SNPs of ABCB1 showed nominal associations with MDD; the other four SNPs of the ABCB1 gene were not associated with MDD. CONCLUSION: Chinese individuals carrying the TG haplotype of rs1045642-rs2032582 had a nearly 53% lower risk of developing MDD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to analyze the effect of ABCB1 polymorphism on the risk of MDD in a Chinese population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.2147/NDT.S87175,"Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder",26347319,PMC4531014

However, the collective randomized trial database across phases of bipolar disorder allows one to identify clinical characteristics that inform the likelihood of desired treatment outcomes. In turn, those characteristics, termed moderators and mediators of drug response, enable those who administer treatment to construct clinical profiles that can help them tailor pharmacotherapies to the features of a given patient rather than simply to an overall diagnosis. Bipolar disorder typically involves more heterogeneous than uniform clinical presentations, partly because of its highly prevalent psychiatric and medical comorbid conditions. Further clinical diversity arises from characteristics such as bipolar I versus II disorder subtype, rapid cycling, mixed versus pure affective episodes, psychosis, anxiety, chronicity, cognitive dysfunction, and suicidality, among other distinguishing features. By coupling such profiles with an awareness of the psychotropic breadth of spectrum held by particular medications, clinicians can devise strategic combination therapy regimens, capitalizing on synergies and using drugs that exert multiple relevant effects, addressing comorbid conditions, incorporating medications that could offset adverse effects of other agents, and avoiding or deprescribing medication options that lack known evidence to target symptoms within the clinical profile of a given patient.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1176/appi.focus.20190005,Bipolar Disorder,32047366,PMC6999206

Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in several genes that regulate lipid metabolism can influence the levels of these lipids and response to drug treatment. We have investigated in an exploratory study whether polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC3), apolipoprotein A-V gene (ApoA5) and lipoprotein lipase genes influence differential lipid response to treatment with three second generation antipsychotics-olanzapine, clozapine and risperidone-or treatment with a first generation antipsychotic. A total of 189 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were being treated with a single antipsychotic were studied in a cross-sectional study design in which fasting serum cholesterol and triglycerides and selected single-nucleotide polymorphosms (SNPs) in the three lipid metabolism genes were assessed. The treatment with antipsychotic monotherapy makes drug haplotype ascertainment less complex. Our analyses showed several nominally significant drug x gene and drug x haplotype interactions. The rarer C allele or the ApoA5_1131 (T/C) SNP was associated with higher cholesterol levels in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics and lower cholesterol levels in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine. The rarer C allele of the ApoA5_SW19 (G/C) SNP was associated with higher cholesterol in risperidone-treated patients. An ApoA5 CG haplotype was associated with decreased cholesterol in olanzapine- or clozapine-treated patients and higher cholesterol in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics. The presence of the rarer T allele of the ApoC3_1100 (C/T) SNP or the presence of the ApoC3 TG haplotype was associated with decreased triglyceride levels in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine and a nonsignificant trend for increased triglycerides in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics. The presence of the ApoC3 CC haplotype was associated with increased triglycerides in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine. The overall magnitude of the effects was not large. These results provide a potential initial step toward a pharmacogenetic approach to selection of antipsychotic treatment which may help minimize the side effect of increases in serum lipids.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/sj.tpj.6500474,"Adult;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Apolipoprotein A-V;Apolipoprotein C-III/*genetics;Apolipoproteins A/*genetics;Benzodiazepines/adverse effects;Clozapine/adverse effects;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Haplotypes;Humans;Lipids/*blood;Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics;Male;Middle Aged;Olanzapine;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Schizophrenia/blood/*drug therapy/genetics;Antipsychotic Agents;Schizophrenia",17726453,

One was drawn from a large health system by applying natural language processing to electronic health records (i2b2 cohort). The second consisted of a multicenter study of sequential antidepressant treatments, Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression.

RESULTS: Our results demonstrated initial significant associations of two SNPs for DRD2 (rs11608185, genotype: chi(2) = 6.29, p-value = 0.043; rs6275, genotype: chi(2) = 8.91, p-value = 0.011), and one SNP in the COMT gene (rs4680, genotype: chi(2) = 6.67, p-value = 0.035 and allele: chi(2) = 4.75, p-value = 0.029; odds ratio: 1.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.73), but not after correction for multiple comparisons indicating a weak association of individual markers of DRD2 and COMT with schizophrenia. Multifactor-dimensionality reduction analysis suggested a two locus model (rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT) as the best model for gene-gene interaction with 90% cross-validation consistency and 42.42% prediction error in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients. CONCLUSION: The present study thus emphasizes the need for multigene interaction studies in complex disorders such as schizophrenia and to understand response to drug treatment, which could lead to a targeted and more effective treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.2217/14622416.10.2.277,"Adult;Amino Acid Substitution;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics;Case-Control Studies;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics;Exons;Female;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease;*Genetic Variation;Humans;India;Male;*Polymorphism, Genetic;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptors, Dopamine D3/*genetics;Reference Values;Schizophrenia/*genetics;Young Adult;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Schizophrenia",19207030,

Genetic variation of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme can influence the optimal dosage needed for individual patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic screening to accelerate drug dosing in older patients with depression initiating nortriptyline or venlafaxine. METHODS/PROCEDURES: In this randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly allocated to one of the study arms. In the intervention arm (DG-I), the specific genotype accompanied by a standardized dosing recommendation based on the patients' genotype and the prescribed drug was directly communicated to the physician of the participant. In both the deviating genotype control arm (DG-C) and the nonrandomized control arm, the physician of the participants was not informed about the genotype and the associated dosing advise. The primary outcome was the time needed to reach adequate drug levels: (1) blood levels within the therapeutic range and (2) no dose adjustments within the previous 3 weeks. FINDINGS/RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in mean time to reach adequate dose or time to adequate dose between DG-I and DG-C. Compared with the nonrandomized control arm group, adequate drug levels were reached significantly faster in the DG-I group (log-rank test; P = 0.004), and there was a similar nonsignificant trend for the DG-C group (log-rank test; P = 0.087). IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support pharmacogenetic CYP2D6 screening to accelerate dose adjustment for nortriptyline and venlafaxine in older patients with depression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1097/JCP.0000000000001129,"Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Double-Blind Method;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nortriptyline/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;Time Factors;Venlafaxine Hydrochloride/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Pharmacogenetics;Nortriptyline",31688392,

Exploratory study on association of genetic variation in TBC1D1 with antipsychotic-induced weight gain.,2013,3,,Human psychopharmacology,1099-1077 (Electronic),28,2,183-7,Brandl EJ and Tiwari AK and Lett TA and Shaikh SA and Lieberman JA and Meltzer HY and Kennedy JL and Müller DJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23364847/,eng,,England,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that antipsychotics with high propensity for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) influence glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) mediated glucose intake. Variation in the gene encoding TBC1 domain family member 1 (TBC1D1), a Rab-GTPase activating protein regulating GLUT4 trafficking, has been associated with obesity. Therefore, we investigated the impact of TBC1D1 polymorphisms on AIWG. METHODS: We analyzed rs9852 and rs35859249 in TBC1D1 in 195 schizophrenia subjects treated mostly with clozapine or olanzapine for up to 14 weeks. Association was tested using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance with change (%) from baseline weight as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance showed a non-significant trend for lower weight gain in carriers of the T-allele of rs9852 than in C-allele homozygotes (p = 0.063). This effect was more pronounced in the subgroup of patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine (p = 0.024). For rs35859249, no significant association with AIWG could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study examining the association between TBC1D1 and AIWG. The moderate association of rs9852, located in the 3'UTR near a miRNA binding site, indicates an influence of TBC1D1 on AIWG. Further investigations remain necessary to elucidate the role of this gene in AIWG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1002/hup.2288,Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Female;GTPase-Activating Proteins/*genetics;Genetic Association Studies/methods;Genetic Variation/*genetics;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics;Weight Gain/*drug effects/*genetics;Weight Gain;Genetic Variation;Antipsychotic Agents,23364847,

Therefore, it is important to use the pathway-based approach and study metabolic and signaling pathways, such as dopaminergic and serotonergic. Serotonin pathway has an important role in brain signaling, nevertheless, its role in SZ is not as thoroughly examined as that of dopamine pathway. In this study, we reviewed serotonin pathway genes and genetic variations associated with SZ, including variations at DNA, RNA, and epigenetic level. We obtained 30 serotonin pathway genes from Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and used these genes for the literature review. We extracted 20 protein coding serotonin pathway genes with genetic variations associated with SZ onset, development, and treatment from 31 research papers. Genes associated with SZ are present on all levels of serotonin pathway: serotonin synthesis, transport, receptor binding, intracellular signaling, and reuptake; however, regulatory genes are poorly researched. We summarized common challenges of genetic association studies and presented some solutions. The analysis of reported serotonin pathway-SZ associations revealed lack of information about certain serotonin pathway genes potentially associated with SZ. Furthermore, it is becoming clear that interactions among serotonin pathway genes and their regulators may bring further knowledge about their involvement in SZ.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1002/ajmg.b.32766,"Brain/metabolism;Disease Progression;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Genetic Variation/genetics;Humans;Male;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Schizophrenia/*genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology;Serotonergic Neurons/metabolism/physiology;Serotonin/*genetics/metabolism;Schizophrenia",31674148,

Participants were 20 children with PWS, and 20 healthy children matched for age, sex and body mass index. Behavioural symptoms and co-occurring psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). We found significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-13 in patients with PWS. There were significant positive correlations between the levels of IL-1β and scores of the following externalizing and internalizing CBCL domains: withdrawn/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent and aggressive behaviour in PWS children. Moreover, higher levels of IL-13 were associated with more severe psychopathology in terms of social and attention problems as well as delinquent and aggressive behaviour. Our findings imply that subclinical inflammation, observed as elevated IL-1β and IL-13 levels, appears only in PWS patients and is correlated to several psychopathological symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1007/s00787-020-01568-7,Child;Child Behavior/*psychology;Female;Humans;Male;Phenotype;Prader-Willi Syndrome/*psychology;Prader-Willi Syndrome;Only Child,32495042,PMC8140962

Advanced proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques enable the measurement of levels of lactate, the main marker of mitochondrial dysfunction, and glutathione, the predominant brain antioxidant. The objective of this study was to measure brain lactate and glutathione levels in bipolar disorder and healthy controls. METHODS: Eighty-eight individuals (50 bipolar disorder and 38 healthy controls) underwent 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (2x2x4.5cm(3)) using a 2-D JPRESS sequence. Lactate and glutathione were quantified using the ProFit software program. RESULTS: Bipolar disorder patients had higher dorsal anterior cingulate cortex lactate levels compared with controls. Glutathione levels did not differ between euthymic bipolar disorder and controls. There was a positive correlation between lactate and glutathione levels specific to bipolar disorder. No influence of medications on metabolites was observed. CONCLUSION: This is the most extensive magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of lactate and glutathione in bipolar disorder to date, and results indicated that euthymic bipolar disorder patients had higher levels of lactate, which might be an indication of altered mitochondrial function. Moreover, lactate levels correlated with glutathione levels, indicating a compensatory mechanism regardless of bipolar disorder diagnosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1093/ijnp/pyw032,Adolescent;Adult;Bipolar Disorder/*metabolism;Case-Control Studies;Female;Glutathione/*metabolism;Gyrus Cinguli/*metabolism;Humans;Lactic Acid/*metabolism;Male;Middle Aged;Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Young Adult;Bipolar Disorder;Lactation;Glutathione;Lactic Acid;Lactates,27207914,PMC5006200

METHODS: All patients were treated with risperidone for 8 weeks. The CYP2D6 genotyping was performed by allele-specific PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (for alleles *3,*4,*6) and long-distance PCR (for duplications and allele *5), while real-time PCR analysis was used for the ABCB1 G2677T/A and C3435T variants. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH risperidone were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The number of patients with the CYP2D6 wild type (wt)/wt, wt/mutation (mut) and mut/mut genotype was 43, 32 and 8, respectively. The number of patients with the ABCB1 2677G/G, G/T and T/T variants was 29, 42 and 12, respectively; those with the 3435CC, C/T and T/T variants was 25, 37 and 21, respectively. The CYP2D6 genotype had a strong effect on the steady-state dose-corrected plasma levels (C/D) of risperidone, its 9-OH metabolite and the active moiety, while the ABCB1 2677 T/T and 3435 T/T genotypes has similarly strong effects on the active moiety C/D. The CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had a significantly higher risperidone C/D and active moiety C/D and lower 9-OH risperidone C/D. The ABCB1 3435 T allele and the ABCB1 2667 T-3435 T haplotype carriers were more frequent among subjects without extrapyramidal syndromes. Patients showed significant improvements in positive and general symptoms, but not in negative symptoms. These changes were not related to variations in genetic and drug concentration data. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CYP2D6 and ABCB1 G2677T and C3435T may be useful determinants of risperidone plasma concentrations, but the clinical implications of these associations in relation to treatment response and side-effects remain unclear.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00228-010-0850-1,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/metabolism;Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse           effects/*blood/pharmacokinetics;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism;Female;Genotype;Humans;Isoxazoles/blood;Male;Middle Aged;*Mutation;Paliperidone Palmitate;Pyrimidines/blood;Risperidone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*blood/pharmacokinetics;Sample Size;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism;Treatment Outcome;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Schizophrenia;Pharmacogenetics;Risperidone",20563569,

However, most conferr a risk of antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). The objective of this investigation was to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AIWG, followed by comprehensive, post-GWAS approaches. METHODS: We investigated n = 201 schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients of European and African American ancestry who were treated primarily with clozapine or olanzapine. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis for AIWG, defined primarily as a percentage of weight change from baseline. RESULTS: When examining Europeans (n = 147), we noticed an association between rs62097526 (β = 0.39, p = 3.59 × 10-6, CADD = 2.213) variant, located downstream of the CIDEA gene, which is considered a risk factor for AIWG. In the entire sample, we observed a significant association between rs1525085 (β = 0.411, p = 3.15 × 10-9) variant of the DGKB gene and AIWG. The association was nominally significant in Europeans (β = 0.271, p = 0.002) and African Americans (β = 0.579, p = 5.73 × 10-5) with the same risk allele. Our top genes (p < 5 × 10-5) were enriched in the GWAS catalog for the risk of obesity and interacted with the known risk factors for obesity (G6PD) and diabetes (IRS1). In addition, these genes are targeted by miRNAs related to schizophrenia (mir-34a) and obesity (mir-19b). However, our polygenic risk score analyses did not provide support for major genetic overlap between obesity and the risk of AIWG. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we propose that the CIDEA and DGKB genes are risk factors for AIWG in transethnic populations.

Adverse effects of antipsychotics, including weight gain, may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical, biochemical and genetic factors associated with MetS among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using second-generation antipsychotics (SGA). Methods: A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Embase to identify all cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and clinical trials investigating associations with MetS in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using SGAs. We extracted and enumerated clinical, biochemical and genetic factors reported to be associated with MetS. We defined factors associated with MetS as factors being reported as associated with MetS in two or more studies. Results: 58 studies were included in this review (n = 12,123). In total, 62 factors were found to be associated with increased risk of MetS. Thirty one out of 58 studies investigated factors that were reported as associated with MetS in two or more studies. With regard to clinical factors, we found gender, higher age, concomitant use of mood stabilizers, higher baseline and current BMI, earlier SGA exposure, higher dose, longer duration of treatment, psychosis and tobacco smoking to be significantly associated with MetS. Furthermore, the biochemical factors hypo-adiponectinemia, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher white blood cell (WBC) count were identified as factors associated with MetS. Among pharmacogenetic factors, the rs1414334 C-allele of the HTR2C-gene was associated with MetS in patients using SGA. Conclusion: In this systematic review investigating clinical, biochemical and genetic factors associated with MetS in patients using SGAs we found that higher age, higher baseline BMI, higher current BMI and male as well as female gender were positively associated with MetS across all antipsychotics. This study may set the stage for the application of clinical, biochemical and genetic factors to predict the risk of developing MetS in patients using SGAs. Future research is needed to determine which patients using SGAs are at risk to develop MetS in clinical practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3389/fpsyt.2021.625935,Schizophrenia;Molecular Biology,33868046,PMC8044798
Genetic correlates of olanzapine-induced weight gain in schizophrenia subjects from north India: role of metabolic pathway genes.,2008,8,,Pharmacogenomics,1744-8042 (Electronic),9,8,1055-68,Srivastava V and Deshpande SN and Nimgaonkar VL and Lerer B and Thelma B,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18681781/,eng,,England,"AIM: Olanzapine is an efficacious drug often used as a first-line medication in the treatment for schizophrenia. However, weight gain is a notable adverse drug reaction of this medication in a proportion of patients and a major cause of noncompliance. Several hypotheses, including a contribution from hormonal, physiological and environmental factors, have been postulated. In this study, we aimed to analyze a possible association of genetic polymorphisms at four important candidate genes involved in appetite regulation and antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome with olanzapine-induced weight gain. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 154 schizophrenia subjects were recruited in a systematic, 6-week, open-label trial of olanzapine. We investigated the contribution of 14 polymorphisms from four genes, namely, leptin, lipoprotein lipase, tri-acyl-glycerol lipase and citrate lyase using a binary logistic regression analysis towards olanzapine-induced weight gain. RESULTS: rs 4731426 C/G SNP, a variant in the leptin gene, was moderately associated with median weight gain (Delta weight(m); [p = 0.05; OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 0.99-4.90]) and significantly associated with extreme weight gain (Delta weight(e) [p = 0.019; OR: 11.43; 95% CI: 1.49-87.55]) when average drug dose was included in a regression model. Using in silico analysis, we found that this associated intronic SNP in the leptin gene alters the binding of zinc finger 5, a transcription factor. CONCLUSION: The leptin gene may be a promising candidate for olanzapine-induced weight gain. As the associations are modest, replicate studies are warranted. This approach may facilitate rationalized drug regimens.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/14622416.9.8.1055,"Adult;Benzodiazepines/*adverse effects;Female;Genetic Linkage/drug effects/genetics;Humans;India;Leptin/genetics;Male;Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects/*genetics;Middle Aged;Olanzapine;Polymorphism, Genetic/drug effects/genetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism;Weight Gain/*drug effects/*genetics;Weight Gain;Schizophrenia",18681781,
Association of a Single-Nucleotide Variant rs11100494 of the NPY5R Gene with Antipsychotic-Induced Metabolic Disorders.,2022,1,18,Pharmaceutics,1999-4923 (Print),14,2,,Dobrodeeva VS and Shnayder NA and Novitsky MA and Asadullin AR and Vaiman EE and Petrova MM and Limankin OV and Neznanov NG and Garganeeva NP and Nasyrova RF,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35213955/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: The usage of antipsychotics (APs) is the most robust and scientifically based approach in the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs). The efficiency of APs is based on a range of target receptors of the central nervous system (CNS): serotoninergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic and cholinergic. Metabolic disorders are the most severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and lead to cardiovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality in patients with SSDs. Neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 (NPY5R) is known in the chain of interaction to target receptors for APs, agouti-related peptide receptors and proopiomelanocortin receptors. We studied the association of the single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) rs11100494 and rs6837793 of the NPY5R gene, and rs16147, rs5573, rs5574 of the NPY gene, with metabolic disorders in Russian patients with SSDs. METHODS: We examined 99 patients with SSDs (mean age-24.56 years old). The mean duration of APs monotherapy was 8 weeks. The biochemical blood test included levels of glucose, cholesterol, lipoproteins, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein and albumin. Anthropometry included weight, height, waist circumference and hip circumference. We used real-time PCR to study the carriage of major and minor alleles of the SNV rs11100494 (1164C>A) of the NPY5R gene (chromosome localization-4q32.2). Group 1 comprised 25 patients with SSDs taking APs with a change in body weight of more than 6% since the start of APs therapy. Group 2 comprised 74 patients with SSDs taking APs with a change in body weight of less than 6% since the start of APs therapy. RESULTS: We show the significance of genetic risk factors (carriage of major allele C of SNV rs11100494 of the NPY5R gene) for the development of AP-induced weight gain in Russian patients with SSDs. The allele C predisposes to AP-induced weight gain (OR = 33.48 [95% CI: 12.62; 88.82], p-value < 0.001). Additionally, the results of our study demonstrate that first-generation APs (FGAs) are more likely to cause an increase in serum transaminase levels but are less likely to increase body weight. Second-generation APs (SGAs) are more likely to cause weight gain and changes in serum glucose levels. CONCLUSION: Our study shows the predictive role of the allele C of SNV rs11100494 of the NPY5R gene in the development of AP-induced weight gain. However, we did not find a significant association between biochemical markers and this SNV in Russian patients with SSDs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.3390/pharmaceutics14020222,Antipsychotic Agents,35213955,PMC8876767

This study aimed to determine the influence of genetic polymorphisms in the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) genes, and the possible role of blood prolactin concentrations on sexual function in schizophrenic patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: Male remitted schizophrenic patients (n = 100), who were living with a sexual partner and receiving antipsychotic drug monotherapy for at least 6 months, were assessed for sexual and erectile dysfunction using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale and the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function. Blood samples were taken for plasma prolactin determination and genotyped for four polymorphisms: DRD2 (-141C Ins/Del and Taq1A) and eNOS gene (G894T and T-786C). RESULTS: The -141C Ins/Del, but not Taq1A, polymorphism of the DRD2 gene was significantly associated with sexual dysfunction with the del allele being less frequent in sexual dysfunction subjects. Neither of the eNOS polymorphisms, G894T or T-786C, was significantly associated with sexual or erectile dysfunction. Prolactin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with erectile dysfunction but did not reach significance in those with sexual dysfunction. Prolactin was also reduced in -141C Del allele carriers. The frequency and severity of sexual dysfunction in the patients receiving typical antipsychotics was significantly greater than those receiving risperidone or clozapine, while prolactin concentrations were significantly higher in subjects receiving risperidone compared with those receiving clozapine or typical antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence indicating that antipsychotic drug treatment in men is associated with a variant in the DRD2 gene in which the -141C Del allele might be a protective factor. While this may, in part, be mediated by effects on prolactin, other factors are likely to contribute to the greater sexual dysfunction in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.2217/pgs.11.46,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Asians;China/epidemiology;DNA/genetics;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Erectile Dysfunction/chemically induced/genetics;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/genetics;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Prolactin/blood/*physiology;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*complications/*drug therapy;Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/*chemically induced/*genetics;Antipsychotic Agents;Schizophrenia;Receptors, Dopamine D2;Prolactin",21749219,

To discover the status of antidepressant treatments, we established an ensemble predictive model with a feature selection algorithm resulting from the analysis of genetic variants and clinical variables of 421 patients who were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. We also compared our ensemble machine learning framework with other state-of-the-art models including multi-layer feedforward neural networks (MFNNs), logistic regression, support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, naïve Bayes, and random forests. Our data revealed that the ensemble predictive algorithm with feature selection (using fewer biomarkers) performed comparably to other predictive algorithms (such as MFNNs and logistic regression) to derive the perplexing relationship between biomarkers and the status of antidepressant treatments. Our study demonstrates that the ensemble machine learning framework may present a useful technique to create bioinformatics tools for discriminating non-responders from responders prior to antidepressant treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.3390/ph13100305,Antidepressive Agents,33065962,PMC7599952

Currently, antidepressants are among the major ways to ease or treat MDD. However, the existing antidepressants have limited efficacy in treating MDD, with a large fraction of patients either responding inadequately or differently to antidepressants during the treatment. Pharmacogenetics studies have found that the genetic features of some genes are associated with the antidepressant efficacy. In order to obtain a better understanding on the relationship between the genetic factors and antidepressant treatment response, we compiled a list of 233 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with the antidepressant efficacy in treating MDD. Of the 13 non-synonymous SNPs in the list, three (rs1065852, rs3810651, and rs117986340) may influence the structures and function of the corresponding proteins. Besides, the influence of rs1065852 on the structure of CYP2D6 was further investigated via molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed that compared to the native CYP2D6 the flexibility of the F-G loop was reduced in the mutant. As a portion of the substrate access channel, the lower flexibility of F-G loop may reduce the ability of the substrates to enter the channel, which may be the reason for the lower enzyme activity of mutant. This study may help us to understand the impact of genetic variation on antidepressant efficacy and provide clues for developing new antidepressants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00151,"Depressive Disorder;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Depressive Disorder, Major;Antidepressive Agents",32256400,PMC7093583
Schizophrenia Polygenic Risk Score as a Predictor of Antipsychotic Efficacy in First-Episode Psychosis.,2019,1,1,The American journal of psychiatry,1535-7228 (Electronic),176,1,21-28,Zhang JP and Robinson D and Yu J and Gallego J and Fleischhacker WW and Kahn RS and Crespo-Facorro B and Vazquez-Bourgon J and Kane JM and Malhotra AK and Lencz T,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30392411/,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Pharmacogenomic studies of antipsychotics have typically examined effects of individual polymorphisms. By contrast, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can quantify the influence of thousands of common alleles of small effect in a single measure. The authors examined whether PRSs for schizophrenia were predictive of antipsychotic efficacy in four independent cohorts of patients with first-episode psychosis (total N=510). METHOD: All study subjects received initial treatment with antipsychotic medication for first-episode psychosis, and all were genotyped on standard single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. PRS was computed based on the results of the large-scale schizophrenia GWAS reported by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Symptoms were measured by using total symptom rating scales at baseline and at week 12 or at the last follow-up visit before dropout. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, higher PRS significantly predicted higher symptom scores at the 12-week follow-up (controlling for baseline symptoms, sex, age, and ethnicity). The PRS threshold set at a p value <0.01 gave the strongest result in the discovery cohort and was used to replicate the findings in the other three cohorts. Higher PRS significantly predicted greater posttreatment symptoms in the combined replication analysis and was individually significant in two of the three replication cohorts. Across the four cohorts, PRS was significantly predictive of adjusted 12-week symptom scores (pooled partial r=0.18; 3.24% of variance explained). Patients with low PRS were more likely to be treatment responders than patients with high PRS (odds ratio=1.91 in the two Caucasian samples). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher PRS for schizophrenia tended to have less improvement with antipsychotic drug treatment. PRS burden may have potential utility as a prognostic biomarker.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17121363,Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Episode of Care;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Multifactorial Inheritance;Predictive Value of Tests;Prognosis;Psychopathology;*Psychotic Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/psychology;Risk Assessment/*methods;*Schizophrenia/diagnosis/drug therapy;Schizophrenic Psychology;Treatment Outcome;Antipsychotic Agents;Schizophrenia;Psychotic Disorders,30392411,PMC6461047

However, the relationships between abnormality in the glutathione system and pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain uncertain due to inconsistent findings on glutathione levels and/or glutathione-related enzyme activities in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Original studies, in which three metabolite levels (glutathione, glutathione disulfide, and total glutathione (glutathione+glutathione disulfide)) and five enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutamate-cysteine ligase, glutathione synthetase, and glutathione S-transferase) were measured with any techniques in both patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, were included. Standardized mean differences were calculated to determine the group differences in the glutathione levels with a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 41, 9, 15, 38, and seven studies which examined glutathione, glutathione disulfide, total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, respectively. Patients with schizophrenia had lower levels of both glutathione and total glutathione and decreased activity of glutathione peroxidase compared to controls. Glutathione levels were lower in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia than those in controls while glutathione levels did not differ between patients with first-episode psychosis and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that there may be glutathione deficits and abnormalities in the glutathione redox cycle in patients with schizophrenia. However, given the small number of studies examined the entire glutathione system, further studies are needed to elucidate a better understanding of disrupted glutathione function in schizophrenia, which may pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in this disorder.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1177/0269881119845820,Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/*metabolism;Glutathione/*metabolism;Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism;Glutathione Reductase/*metabolism;Glutathione Synthase/*metabolism;Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism;Humans;*Oxidative Stress;Schizophrenia/enzymology/*metabolism;Schizophrenia;Glutathione,31039654,

Here, we report microarray analyses revealing in APO-SUS rats, relative to their counterpart APO-UNSUS rats, a reduced expression of Aph-1b, a component of the gamma-secretase enzyme complex that is involved in multiple (neuro)developmental signaling pathways. The reduced expression is due to a duplicon-based genomic rearrangement event resulting in an Aph-1b dosage imbalance. The expression levels of the other gamma-secretase components were not affected. However, gamma-secretase cleavage activity was significantly changed, and the APO-SUS/-UNSUS Aph-1b genotypes segregated with a number of behavioral phenotypes.

Iloperidone for schizophrenia: a review of the efficacy and safety profile for this newly commercialised second-generation antipsychotic.,2009,8,,International journal of clinical practice,1742-1241 (Electronic),63,8,1237-48,Citrome L,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19624791/,eng,,India,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the efficacy and safety of iloperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. DATA SOURCES: The pivotal registration trials were accessed by querying http://www.pubmed.gov, http://www.fda.gov and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov for the search term 'iloperidone'. STUDY SELECTION: Four published primary reports of phase III studies were identified as well as preclinical animal and receptor affinity studies that describe potential mechanisms of action and pharmacogenomic studies that identify potential genetic biomarkers for efficacy and tolerability. Product labelling provided additional data. DATA EXTRACTION: Descriptions of the principal results and calculation of number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) for relevant dichotomous outcomes were extracted from the study reports. Additional safety outcomes subject to NNH analysis were obtained from product labelling. DATA SYNTHESIS: Iloperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic agent indicated for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Iloperidone has been evaluated in several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials. The oral formulation has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the symptoms of acute schizophrenia at fixed daily doses ranging from 12 to 24 mg. Data reported for categorical definitions of response using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were limited to one study and specifically to rates of achieving a > or = 20% decrease in the positive subscale from baseline; significantly more patients receiving iloperidone 24 mg/day (72%) than placebo (52%) met this criterion, yielding a NNT of five. Iloperidone should be titrated slowly to avoid orthostatic hypotension, potentially delaying the achievement of a therapeutic dose level. There appears to be a dose relationship for adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence and dry mouth; for example NNH vs. placebo for somnolence was 25 for iloperidone 10-16 mg/day and 10 for 20-24 mg/day. There is a possibility of a therapeutic dose response as well. Iloperidone is essentially free of extra-pyramidal side effects. Iloperidone is associated with weight gain comparable with risperidone. Long-term double-blind maintenance studies have demonstrated iloperidone's non-inferiority to haloperidol for relapse prevention. Product labelling includes a warning about the potential for QT interval prolongation. At present there are no efficacy studies available that are powered to directly compare iloperidone with other second-generation antipsychotics. The development of a depot formulation of iloperidone as well as efforts to identify genetic biomarkers for prediction of both efficacy and tolerability are in progress. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from paliperidone, iloperidone is the first new second-generation antipsychotic to be commercialised in the USA since 2002. From the limited registration data, iloperidone appears to be relatively well tolerated once titrated to a therapeutic level and can be a useful option to consider. The development of a depot formulation and potential for genetic biomarkers may make this agent compelling. Further comparisons with other available agents among patients with schizophrenia in the 'real world' are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02142.x,"Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic;Drug Labeling;Humans;Isoxazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sample Size;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;Treatment Outcome;Antipsychotic Agents;Schizophrenia",19624791,

It is presumed that there are interindividual differences in ANS dysfunction that correspond to pharmacogenetics. In this study, we investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1, CYP1A2, and UGT1A4 are associated with this observed ANS dysfunction. METHODS: A total of 91 schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine monotherapy participated in this study. A power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used to assess ANS activity. The TaqMan system was used to genotype seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP1A2 (rs2069514 and rs762551), UGT1A4 (rs2011425), and ABCB1 (rs1045642, rs1128503, rs2032582, rs2235048). RESULTS: Sympathetic nervous activity was significantly higher in individuals with the UGT1A4 rs2011425 G allele than in those with the UGT1A4 rs2011425 non-G allele (sympathetic activity, p = .001). Furthermore, sympathetic nervous activity was also significantly associated with UGT1A4 rs2011425 genotype as revealed by multiple regression analysis (sympathetic activity, p = .008). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the UGT1A4 rs2011425 polymorphism affects olanzapine tolerability because it is associated with the observed side effects of olanzapine in schizophrenia patients, namely sympathetic dysfunction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12888-020-02492-5,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics;Autonomic Nervous System/metabolism/*physiopathology;Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/*genetics;Female;Genotype;Glucuronosyltransferase/*genetics;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Olanzapine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/physiopathology;Schizophrenia;Autonomic Nervous System;Polymorphism, Genetic",32070304,PMC7027321

Results across cohorts were combined via meta-analysis within a random effects model. Overall, PRS for MDD and neuroticism did not significantly predict antidepressant response but there was a consistent direction of effect, whereby greater genetic loading for both MDD (best MDD result, p < 5*10-5 MDD-PRS at 4 weeks, β = -0.019, S.E = 0.008, p = 0.01) and neuroticism (best neuroticism result, p < 0.1 neuroticism-PRS at 8 weeks, β = -0.017, S.E = 0.008, p = 0.03) were associated with less favourable response.

METHODS: Patients with a CGI-S ≥ 4 and requiring antidepressant medication de novo or changes in their medication regime were recruited at 18 Spanish public hospitals, genotyped with a commercial PGx panel (Neuropharmagen®), and randomized to PGx-guided treatment (n = 155) or treatment as usual (TAU, control group, n = 161), using a computer-generated random list that locked or unlocked psychiatrist access to the results of the PGx panel depending on group allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a sustained response (Patient Global Impression of Improvement, PGI-I ≤ 2) within the 12-week follow-up. Patients and interviewers collecting the PGI-I ratings were blinded to group allocation. Between-group differences were evaluated using χ2-test or t-test, as per data type. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty patients were available for analysis at the end of the 12-week follow-up (PGx n = 136, TAU n = 144). A difference in sustained response within the study period (primary outcome) was not observed (38.5% vs 34.4%, p = 0.4735; OR = 1.19 [95%CI 0.74-1.92]), but the PGx-guided treatment group had a higher responder rate compared to TAU at 12 weeks (47.8% vs 36.1%, p = 0.0476; OR = 1.62 [95%CI 1.00-2.61]), and this difference increased after removing subjects in the PGx-guided group when clinicians explicitly reported not to follow the test recommendations (51.3% vs 36.1%, p = 0.0135; OR = 1.86 [95%CI 1.13-3.05]). Effects were more consistent in patients with 1-3 failed drug trials. In subjects reporting side effects burden at baseline, odds of achieving a better tolerability (Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating Burden subscore ≤2) were higher in the PGx-guided group than in controls at 6 weeks and maintained at 12 weeks (68.5% vs 51.4%, p = 0.0260; OR = 2.06 [95%CI 1.09-3.89]). CONCLUSIONS: PGx-guided treatment resulted in significant improvement of MDD patient's response at 12 weeks, dependent on the number of previously failed medication trials, but not on sustained response during the study period.

Vulnerable combinations of functional dopaminergic polymorphisms to late-onset treatment resistant schizophrenia.,2018,,,PloS one,1932-6203 (Electronic),13,11,e0207133,Oishi K and Kanahara N and Takase M and Oda Y and Nakata Y and Niitsu T and Ishikawa M and Sato Y and Iyo M,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30408108/,eng,,,"BACKGROUND: A significant portion of patients with schizophrenia who respond to initial antipsychotic treatment acquire treatment resistance. One of the possible pathogeneses of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (Ai-DSP). Patients with this disease progression might share some genetic vulnerabilities, and thus determining individuals with higher risks of developing Ai-DSP could contribute to preventing iatrogenic development of TRS. Therefore, we decided to examine whether combinations of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to affect dopaminergic functions are related to Ai-DSP development. METHODS: In this case-control study, 357 Japanese participants diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited and divided into two groups, those with and without Ai-DSP. As functional SNPs, we examined rs10770141 of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, rs4680 of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, and rs1799732 and rs1800497 of the DRD2 genes, which are known to possess strong directional ties to dopamine synthesis, dopamine degradation and post-synaptic DRD2 prevalence, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 357 Japanese patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 130 were classified as Ai-DSP(+) and the other 227 as Ai-DSP(-). Significantly higher proportions of Ai-DSP(+) patients were found to have the SNP combinations of rs10770141/rs4680 (57.9%, OR2.654, 95%CI1.036-6.787, P = 0.048) and rs10770141/rs4680/ rs1800497 (64.3%, OR4.230, 95%CI1.306-13.619, P = 0.029). However, no single SNP was associated with Ai-DSP. CONCLUSIONS: We preliminarily found that carrying particular combinations of functional SNPs, which are related to relatively higher dopamine synthesis and dopamine degradation and lower naïve DRD2, might indicate vulnerability to development of Ai-DSP. However, further studies are needed to validate the present results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0207133,"Adolescent;Adult;Age of Onset;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Case-Control Studies;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics;Drug Resistance/*genetics;Female;Genetic Association Studies;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pharmacogenomic Variants;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Preliminary Data;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D2/genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics;Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/genetics;Young Adult;Schizophrenia;Polymorphism, Genetic",30408108,PMC6224074

STUDY DESIGN: Markov state-transition analysis based on clinical studies. METHODS: Clinical validity and utility were based on published findings in prospective clinical studies of a commercially available CPGx test. Data for quality of life, direct costs, and indirect costs were extracted from meta-analyses of published literature on clinical studies and claims databases. Outcomes were assessed from a societal perspective, and included differences between the CPGx and the TAU strategies in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cumulative direct and indirect costs, and cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: CPGx improved the treatment response rate by 70% (1.7 times as high as that with TAU), increasing QALYs by 0.316 years. With these health benefits, CPGx is expected to save $3711 in direct medical costs per patient and $2553 in work productivity costs per patient over the lifetime. The cost-effectiveness of CPGx testing was robust over a wide range of variation in the input parameters, including the scenario when testing efficacy was set to its lower limit. CONCLUSIONS: CPGx testing has been shown by prospective studies to modify treatment decisions for patients nonresponsive to previous treatment(s), with increased rates of treatment response. These effects are projected to increase quality-adjusted survival, and to save both direct and indirect costs to individual patients and society generally.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: economic analysis",,"Antidepressive Agents/economics/*therapeutic use;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Drug Resistance;Humans;Pharmacogenomic Testing/*economics;Quality-Adjusted Life Years;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder;Pharmacogenetics",26247576,

However, current findings on those metabolite levels in schizophrenia have been inconsistent, and the relationship between their abnormalities and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. To summarize the nature of the alterations of glutamatergic and GABAergic systems in schizophrenia, we conducted meta-analyses of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) studies examining these metabolite levels. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Original studies that compared four metabolite levels (Glu, glutamine [Gln], Glx [Glu+Gln], and GABA), as measured by (1)H-MRS, between individuals at high risk for psychosis, patients with first-episode psychosis, or patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (HC) were included. A random-effects model was used to calculate the effect sizes for group differences in these metabolite levels of 18 regions of interest between the whole group or schizophrenia group and HC. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed based on the status of antipsychotic treatment, illness stage, treatment resistance, and magnetic field strength. RESULTS: One-hundred-thirty-four studies met the eligibility criteria, totaling 7993 participants with SZ-spectrum disorders and 8744 HC. 14 out of 18 ROIs had enough numbers of studies to examine the group difference in the metabolite levels. In the whole group, Glx levels in the basal ganglia (g = 0.32; 95% CIs: 0.18-0.45) were elevated. Subgroup analyses showed elevated Glx levels in the hippocampus (g = 0.47; 95% CIs: 0.21-0.73) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (g = 0.25; 95% CIs: 0.05-0.44) in unmedicated patients than HC. GABA levels in the MCC were decreased in the first-episode psychosis group compared with HC (g = -0.40; 95% CIs: -0.62 to -0.17). Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) group had elevated Glx and Glu levels in the MCC (Glx: g = 0.7; 95% CIs: 0.38-1.01; Glu: g = 0.63; 95% CIs: 0.31-0.94) while MCC Glu levels were decreased in the patient group except TRS (g = -0.17; 95% CIs: -0.33 to -0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased glutamatergic metabolite levels and reduced GABA levels indicate that the disruption of excitatory/inhibitory balance may be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.1038/s41380-021-01297-6,Glutamic Acid/metabolism;Glutamine/metabolism;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods;*Schizophrenia/metabolism;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism;Schizophrenia,34584230,

Effects of BDNF polymorphisms on antidepressant action.,2010,12,,Psychiatry investigation,1976-3026 (Electronic),7,4,236-42,Tsai SJ and Hong CJ and Liou YJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21253406/,eng,,,"Evidence suggests that the down-regulation of the signaling pathway involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecular element known to regulate neuronal plasticity and survival, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of major depression. The restoration of BDNF activity induced by antidepressant treatment has been implicated in the antidepressant therapeutic mechanism. Because there is variability among patients with major depressive disorder in terms of response to antidepressant treatment and since genetic factors may contribute to this inter-individual variability in antidepressant response, pharmacogenetic studies have tested the associations between genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes related to antidepressant therapeutic action. In human BDNF gene, there is a common functional polymorphism (Val66Met) in the pro-region of BDNF, which affects the intracellular trafficking of proBDNF. Because of the potentially important role of BDNF in the antidepressant mechanism, many pharmacogenetic studies have tested the association between this polymorphism and the antidepressant therapeutic response, but they have produced inconsistent results. A recent meta-analysis of eight studies, which included data from 1,115 subjects, suggested that the Val/Met carriers have increased antidepressant response in comparison to Val/Val homozygotes, particularly in the Asian population. The positive molecular heterosis effect (subjects heterozygous for a specific genetic polymorphism show a significantly greater effect) is compatible with animal studies showing that, although BDNF exerts an antidepressant effect, too much BDNF may have a detrimental effect on mood. Several recommendations are proposed for future antidepressant pharmacogenetic studies of BDNF, including the consideration of multiple polymorphisms and a haplotype approach, gene-gene interaction, a single antidepressant regimen, controlling for age and gender interactions, and pharmacogenetic effects on specific depressive symptom-clusters.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.4306/pi.2010.7.4.236,"Polymorphism, Genetic;Antidepressive Agents;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor",21253406,PMC3022309

EMA substantially improves downstream accuracy over existing methods, including phasing and genotyping on 10x data, with fewer false variant calls in nearly half the time. EMA effectively resolves particularly challenging alignments in genomic regions that contain nearby homologous elements, uncovering variants in the pharmacogenomically important CYP2D region, and clinically important genes C4 (schizophrenia) and AMY1A (obesity), which go undetected by existing methods.

The effect of its main treatment option, antidepressant drugs (AD), is influenced by genetic and metabolic factors. The ERICH3 rs11580409(A > C) genetic polymorphism was identified as a factor influencing serotonin (5HT) levels in a pharmacometabolomics-informed genome-wide association study. It was also associated with response following AD treatment in several cohorts of depressed patients. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the association of the ERICH3 rs11580409(A > C) genetic polymorphism with response following AD treatment and plasma 5HT levels in METADAP, a cohort of 6-month AD-treated depressed patients. METHODS: Clinical (n = 377) and metabolic (n = 150) data were obtained at baseline and after 3 (M3) and 6 months (M6) of treatment. Linear mixed-effects models and generalized logistic mixed-effects models were used to assess the association of the rs11580409 polymorphism with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score, response and remission rates, and plasma 5HT levels. RESULTS: The interaction between the ERICH3 rs11580409 polymorphism and time was an overall significant factor in mixed-effects models of the HDRS score (F(3,870) = 3.35, P = 0.019). At M6, CC homozygotes had a significantly lower HDRS score compared to A allele carriers (coefficient = -3.50, 95%CI [-6.00--0.99], P = 0.019). No association between rs11580409 and 5HT levels was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an association of rs11580409 with response following long-term AD treatment.

Moreover, personality traits are thought to be associated with response to antidepressants treatment that might partly be mediated by genetic factors. In this study, we examined whether polygenic scores (PGSs) derived from the Big Five personality traits predict treatment response and remission in patients with MDD who were prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on these traits to identify genetic variants underpinning the cross-trait polygenic association. The PGS analysis was performed using data from two cohorts: the Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS, n = 529) and the International SSRI Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ISPC, n = 865). The cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses were conducted by combining GWAS summary statistics on SSRIs treatment outcome and on the personality traits. The results showed that the PGS for openness and neuroticism were associated with SSRIs treatment outcomes at p < 0.05 across P(T) thresholds in both cohorts. A significant association was also found between the PGS for conscientiousness and SSRIs treatment response in the PGRN-AMPS sample. In the cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses, we identified eight loci associated with (a) SSRIs response and conscientiousness near YEATS4 gene and (b) SSRI remission and neuroticism eight loci near PRAG1, MSRA, XKR6, ELAVL2, PLXNC1, PLEKHM1, and BRUNOL4 genes.

While the hypo-activity of serotonin signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder; LSD, an agonist of serotonin type 2 receptor (5-HTR2A) induces psychosis. Therefore, anxiety and depressive disorders are treated by SSRIs which inhibit serotonin transporter (5-HTT) while psychotic disorders are controlled by drugs that block serotonin and/or dopamine receptors. Since genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic dysregulation of 5-HTT are involved in the pathogenesis of mental diseases, we analyzed DNA methylation of 5-HTT promoter in post-mortem brains and saliva samples of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to evaluate its potential application as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic biomarker in SCZ and BD. METHODS: Whole genome DNA methylation profiling was performed for a total of 24 samples (including two saliva samples) using the Illumina 27K (for 12 samples) and 450K DNA methylation array platform (for another 12 samples), followed by bisulfite sequencing to identify candidate CpGs for further analysis. Quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was used to assess the degree of CpG methylation of 5-HTT promoter in 105 post-mortem brains (35 controls, 35 SCZ and 35 BD) and 100 saliva samples (30 controls, 30 SCZ, 20 BD and 20 first degree relatives of SCZ or BD). The U133 2.0 Plus Human Transcriptome array for a total of 30 post-mortem brain samples (each group 10) followed by quantitative real-time PCR was used to study 5-HTT expression in 105 post-mortem brain samples. RESULTS: The qMSP analysis for 5-HTT promoter region showed DNA hypermethylation in post-mortem brain samples of SCZ patients (~30%), particularly in drug free patients (~60%, p=0.04). Similarly, there was a trend for DNA hypermethylation in antipsychotic free BD patients (~50%, p=0.066). qMSP analysis of DNA extracted from the saliva samples also exhibited hypermethylation of 5-HTT promoter in patients with SCZ (~30%, p=0.039), which was more significant in drug naïve SCZ patients (>50%, p=0.0025). However, the difference was not significant between the controls and unaffected first degree relatives of patients with SCZ (p=0.37) and versus patients using antipsychotic drugs (p=0.2). The whole genome transcriptome analysis of post-mortem brain samples showed reduced expression of 5-HTT in SCZ compared to the control subjects (~50%, p=0.008), confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (~40%, p=0.035) which was more significant in drug free SCZ patients (~70%, p=0.022). CONCLUSION: A correlation between reduction in 5-HTT expression and DNA hypermethylation of the 5-HTT promoter in drug naïve SCZ patients suggests that an epigenetically defined hypo-activity of 5-HTT may be linked to SCZ pathogenesis. Furthermore, this epigenetic mark in DNA extracted from saliva can be considered as one of the key determinants in a panel of diagnostic and/or therapeutic biomarkers for SCZ.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.schres.2013.12.007,"Adult;Bipolar Disorder/genetics/pathology;Brain/*metabolism;Case-Control Studies;DNA Methylation/*genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Postmortem Changes;Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics;Saliva;Schizophrenia/*genetics/pathology;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase;DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase;DNA;Schizophrenia",24411530,PMC7863587

Our secondary aim was to analyze the association of CNR1 genotypes with changes of perceived levels of stress. METHODS: We enrolled a sample of 159 patients with FEP from two Croatian psychiatric hospitals between 2014 and 2017. Patients were assessed at baseline and after 18 months. We analyzed the associations of changes in neurocognitive test results and the perceived levels of stress with CNR1 polymorphic loci (rs7766029 and rs12720071) in 121 patients. RESULTS: In the analysis adjusted only for baseline neurocognitive test scores, carriers of rs7766029 CC genotype had significantly (with false discovery rate, FDR < 15%) higher improvement in verbal memory (Wechsler, Wechsler 30') and attention (Digit span F) compared with other participants. In such analysis, rs12720071 carriers of AG genotype had significantly (FDR < 15%) higher improvement in executive functions (Block design), but lower improvement in language functions than AA carriers. In the fully adjusted analysis for age, sex, cannabis use and negative symptoms, only the association of rs7766029 genotypes with the change in the Weschler 30' score was significant (FDR < 15%).

The clinical utility of routine CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotyping (CYP testing) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether routine CYP testing effects the persistence of antipsychotic drug treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-masked, 3-group randomized clinical trial included patients aged 18 years or older who had been diagnosed within the schizophrenic spectrum (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes, F20-F29) and not previously genotyped. A total of 669 of 1406 potentially eligible patients from 12 psychiatric outpatient clinics in Denmark were approached between July 2008 and December 2009. Overall, 528 patients were genotyped and randomly allocated to 1 of 3 study groups or exclusion in a sequence of 1:1:1:3 using a predictive enrichment design, aiming to double the proportion of poor or ultrarapid metabolizers for CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. Outcome measurements were recorded at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Data analysis was performed in December 2012 and updated March 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The trial included 2 intervention groups, where antipsychotic drug treatment was guided by either CYP test (CYP test-guided [CTG]) or structured clinical monitoring (SCM), in which adverse effects and factors influencing compliance were systematically recorded at least once quarterly, and 1 control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was antipsychotic drug persistence, ie, days to first modification of the initial treatment. Secondary outcomes were number of drug and dose changes, adverse effects, and psychotic symptoms, ie, hallucinations and delusions. RESULTS: A total of 528 participants were genotyped, and 311 (median [interquartile range {IQR} age, 41 [30-50] years; 139 [45%] women; median [IQR] duration of illness, 6 [3-13] years) were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 study groups. Overall, 61 participants (20%) were extreme metabolizers. There was no difference in antipsychotic drug persistence between the CTG group and the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.71-1.45) or SCM and the control group (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.61-1.26).

However, very little is known about the genetic factor or the prevalence of cannabis use in the Mexican population with OCD. The objective of this study is to compare the prevalence of use and dependence on cannabis in individuals with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology (OCS) with that of individuals with other psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, depression, and anxiety), and to explore the association between genetic risk and use. The study includes a total of 13,130 individuals evaluated in the second stage of the 2016 National Survey of Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco Use (Encodat 2016), with genetic analysis (polygenic risk scoring) of a subsample of 3,521 individuals. Obsessive symptomatology had a prevalence of 7.2% and compulsive symptomatology a prevalence of 8.6%. The proportion of individuals with OCS who had ever used cannabis was 23.4%, and of those with cannabis dependency was 2.7%, the latter figure higher than that in individuals with other psychiatric symptoms (hypomania, 2.6%; anxiety, 2.8%; depression, 2.3%), except psychosis (5.9%). Individuals with OCS who reported using cannabis had an increased genetic risk for cannabis dependence but not for OCD. We thus cannot know how the increased genetic risk of cannabis dependence in people with OCD is influenced by their pharmacological response to derivatives of THC.

While currently available atypical antipsychotic agents have significantly advanced the treatment of schizophrenia, there is still a great unmet need for new, effective and better-tolerated therapies. Iloperidone, a D(2)/5-HT(2) receptor antagonist, has been recently approved by the US FDA for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Iloperidone has been shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia in four short-term (4-6 weeks) and three long-term (52 weeks) studies with over 3000 patients exposed to treatment. Results also indicated a reassuring safety profile, particularly regarding extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia and prolactin elevation, with a modest effect on weight gain and no medically important changes in cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. As other antipsychotics, iloperidone has been shown to prolong the QTc interval. Since none of the current therapies work for every patient, a pharmacogenetic approach was used to identify genetic markers associated with increased response to iloperidone, suggesting a personalized therapeutic option for this drug. In addition, a long-term 4-week injectable formulation is being developed that may assist with patient compliance. Key development findings for iloperidone are presented here.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1002/pmic.200800563,Antipsychotic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use;Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;Clinical Trials as Topic;Confidence Intervals;Humans;Isoxazoles/chemistry/*therapeutic use;Kaplan-Meier Estimate;Longitudinal Studies;Piperidines/chemistry/*therapeutic use;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/physiopathology;Schizophrenia,19951132,

Beside antipsychotic drugs, other psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants and lithium carbonate can cause this life threatening side-effect. Underlying mechanism of this side-effect is still unknown and debated. So far some risk factors have been identified, with clinical observations and recent pharmacogenetic research suggesting (with inconsistent findings) correlation between genetic mechanisms and predisposition to MNS. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 enzyme through which most psychotropic drugs are metabolized and TaqIA DRD2 which is target for antipsychotic drugs could be the link between pharmacogenetic factors and potential for development of MNS. In this paper we present two case reports with clinical presentation of three consecutive MNS. One patient developed MNS while he was taking combination of drugs: first time haloperidol, promazine and fluphenazine, second time fluphenazine and perazine and third time clozapine, promazine and valproic acid consecutively. The other patient developed MNS while taking following combination of drugs: first time haloperidol and lithium carbonate, second time risperidone and third time clozapine consecutively. Pharmacogenetic analysis for CYP2D6 and TaqI A DRD2 polymorphisms for both patients was done. Genotypisation of CYP2D6*1*3*4*5*6 in both patients showed no evidence of poor metabolizer phenotype. On the other hand, first patient was heterozygous for CYP2D6*4 (genotype *1/*4). CYP2D6 polymorphisms could have clinical significance because may lead to toxicity and unwanted side-effects in standard usual antipsychotic dose ranges. Analysis Taql A DRD2 polymorphism for first patient showed that he is heterozygous for A1 allele (genotype A1A2) which is commonly associated with predisposition to MNS. According to our literature three consecutive MNS are rarely described, and incidence of MNS generally is too low to perform clinical research. Many patophysiological mechanisms may probably underlie this complex and potentially fatal syndrome, still unknown etiology. But, genetic mechanisms could be significant. Further pharmacogenetic research, findings and analysis in patients who develop single or repeated MNS are strongly recommended. In long term, pharmacogenetic analysis, implemented in daily clinical practice, could help in prevention of this extremely serious side-effect.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: case report",,"Adult;*Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics;Clozapine/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Dibenzothiazepines/therapeutic use;Drug Therapy, Combination;Fluphenazine/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Genetic Carrier Screening;Genotype;Haloperidol/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Humans;Lithium Carbonate/therapeutic use;Male;Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome/*genetics;Perazine/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics;Quetiapine Fumarate;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics;Recurrence;Risperidone/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Antipsychotic Agents;Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome;Polymorphism, Genetic",20305604,
GRIK4 polymorphism and its association with antidepressant response in depressed patients: a meta-analysis.,2014,8,,Pharmacogenomics,1744-8042 (Electronic),15,11,1451-9,Kawaguchi DM and Glatt SJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25303296/,eng,,,"AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between a human GRIK4 gene polymorphism (rs1954787) and responsiveness to antidepressant treatment in depressed patients. METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out on five studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs), 95% CIs and a χ(2) test measuring heterogeneity were calculated. A test of publication bias was also conducted. RESULTS: Alleles and genotypes from a total of 2169 depressed patients were analyzed. The results showed that the C allele appeared more frequently than the T allele in responders to treatment (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.035-1.445; z = 2.36; p = 0.018). Similarly, CC homozygotes were more likely than TT homozygotes to respond to treatment (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.107-1.913; z = 2.69; p = 0.007). No evidence of publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: Subjects possessing the C allele or CC genotype of the GRIK4 polymorphism rs1954787 are more likely to respond to antidepressant treatment relative to subjects harboring the T allele and TT genotype. Additional replication of this result is required before this association can be considered definitive, after which it may become possible to employ this marker in conjunction with other known predictors in order to anticipate the outcomes of treatment with antidepressant medications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.2217/pgs.14.96,"Alleles;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Depression/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Male;Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics;Receptors, Kainic Acid/*genetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Antidepressive Agents",25303296,PMC4208722

Ovid Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for herbal medicines with both pharmacological and clinical evidence of psychotropic activity. This updated review now covers clinical trial evidence for 24 herbal medicines in 11 psychiatric disorders. High-quality evidence was found to exist for the use of Piper methysticum (Kava), Passiflora spp. (passionflower) and Galphimia glauca (galphimia) for anxiety disorders; and Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) and Crocus sativus (saffron) for major depressive disorder. Other encouraging herbal medicines with preliminary evidence include Curcuma longa (turmeric) in depression, Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) in affective disorders, and Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo) as an adjunctive treatment in Schizophrenia. Although depression and anxiety are commonly researched, many other mental disorders still require further prospective investigation. Although the previous review suggested increasing the adjunctive study of select herbal medicines with pharmaceuticals, this was still only found to sparingly occur in research designs. Aside from this, future focus should involve the incorporation of more biomarker analysis, in particular pharmacogenomics, to determine genetic factors moderating response to herbal medicines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1002/ptr.6055,"Anxiety/drug therapy/epidemiology;Depression/drug therapy/epidemiology;Herbal Medicine/methods/*trends;Humans;Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology;Phytotherapy/methods/*trends;Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use;Plants, Medicinal/physiology;Herbal Medicine",29575228,

The functional 5-HT₃ receptor forms a pentamer of five symmetrically arranged subunits surrounding a central pore. The 5-HT(3A) subunit was first identified at a molecular level and can form functional homomers or heteromers with the 5-HT(3B) subunit. Recently, three new 5-HT₃ subunits have been discovered and these can also form functional heteromers with the 5-HT(3A) subunit. In addition, splice variants of the 5-HT₃ subunits have also been reported. These findings have markedly increased the complexity of the 5-HT₃ receptor and may form part of the explanation of unresolved differences between studies investigating 5-HT₃ receptor function in cell lines compared with native tissues. In this review we discuss the properties of the different subunits and their distribution to determine if they contribute to functional changes in the 5-HT₃ receptor. Several recent pharmacogenomic studies have revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other variations in the different 5-HT₃ receptor subunits that are associated with various clinical conditions.

Both newly diagnosed patients and those on follow-up with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder with onset before 18 years of age and on lithium prophylaxis as part of treatment-as-usual were recruited for the study. Response to treatment was assessed at the end of two years follow up using ALDA scale. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with treatment response based on previous studies were chosen for analysis. RESULTS: Of 162 who had EOBD, sixty-four fulfilled inclusion criteria and fifty-seven completed the study.

Eight mutation scans have uncovered sixteen polymorphisms in the coding sequence and surrounding 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and much is now known of the distribution of these polymorphisms in various ethnic groups and their linkage disequilibrium relationships. Thus far, evidence exists that the uncommon missense T371G (Phe124Cys) and the common promoter region A-161T polymorphisms may exhibit functional effects and possibly that the common synonymous G861C (or more likely a variant in linkage disequilibrium with G861C) does as well.

Although cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the principal determinant of metabolism of clozapine, the role of CYP1A2 gene in the clinical response to clozapine is uncertain. Hence, we investigated its association with treatment responses and adverse events of clozapine in TRS. METHODS: We evaluated four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CYP1A2 gene, clinical responses and serum clozapine levels in 101 consecutive patients with TRS on stable doses of clozapine. We defined clozapine response a priori and investigated allelic and genotypic associations. We assessed the socio-demographic and clinical profiles, premorbid adjustment, traumatic life events, cognition and disability of the participants, using standard assessment schedules for appropriate multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Our results revealed that CYP1A2 gene SNP (*1C, *1D, *1E and *1F) were not associated with clozapine treatment response, adverse effects, serum clozapine levels or with disability (p values > 0.10). CONCLUSION: As CYP1A2 gene SNP do not help to predict the clinical response to clozapine, routine screening for them prior to start clozapine is currently unwarranted.

OBJECTIVE: To discover genes and gene sets harboring rare variants associated with short-term antipsychotic medication efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted between July 6, 2010, and December 31, 2011, 3023 patients recruited in China of Chinese Han descent with schizophrenia with total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score ≥ 60 received a 6-week treatment of antipsychotic medications randomly chosen from 5 atypical and 2 typical antipsychotic medications. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in 316 participants (grouped into those with the best response [n=156] and those who had no response [n=160] to the antipsychotic medication prescribed), according to the total PANSS score reduction rate after 6 weeks of treatment. Validation was performed using targeted sequencing in an independent sample of 1920 patients. Data analyses was performed between March 15, 2016, and March 1, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Drug efficacy at week 6 was assessed according to the change in PANSS scores from baseline. Extremely good and extremely poor responders were selected for an initial WES association study, from which a subset of genes showing putative association was selected for independent replication with a targeted sequencing approach. RESULTS: Of the 3023 patients (1549 [51.24%] female and 1474 [48.8%] male; mean [SD] age, 31.2 [7.9] years), 2336 (77.3%) were eligible for genetic analysis. After quality-control exclusions, 316 patients (10.5%) were included for WES and 1920 (63.5%) were included for replication. In the WES discovery stage, 2 gene sets (reduced NMDA [N-methyl-D-aspartate]-mediated synaptic currents and reduced AMPA [α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid]-mediated synaptic currents) were found to be enriched with rare damaging variants in the nonresponder group, suggesting the involvement of these gene sets in antipsychotic medication efficacy. Reduced NMDA-mediated synaptic currents gene set was further replicated in an independent sample using targeting sequencing. No statistically significant differences in antipsychotic drug response were found among the patients who received different antipsychotic drugs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Genetic variation in glutamatergic or NMDA neurotransmission is implicated in short-term antipsychotic medication efficacy; WES may have utility in the study of rare genetic variation in pharmacogenetics.

People with CFS have no characteristic physical signs or diagnostic laboratory abnormalities, and the etiology and pathophysiology remain unknown. CFS represents a complex illness that includes alterations in homeostatic systems, involves multiple body systems and results from the combined action of many genes, environmental factors and risk-conferring behavior. In order to achieve understanding of complex illnesses, such as CFS, studies must collect relevant epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and then integrate, analyze and interpret the information so as to obtain meaningful clinical and biological insight. This issue of Pharmacogenomics represents such an approach to CFS. Data was collected during a 2-day in-hospital study of persons with CFS, other medically and psychiatrically unexplained fatiguing illnesses and nonfatigued controls identified from the general population of Wichita, KS, USA. While in the hospital, the participants' psychiatric status, sleep characteristics and cognitive functioning was evaluated, and biological samples were collected to measure neuroendocrine status, autonomic nervous system function, systemic cytokines and peripheral blood gene expression. The data generated from these assessments was made available to a multidisciplinary group of 20 investigators from around the world who were challenged with revealing new insight and algorithms for integration of this complex, high-content data and, if possible, identifying molecular markers and elucidating pathophysiology of chronic fatigue. The group was divided into four teams with representation from the disciplines of medicine, mathematics, biology, engineering and computer science. The papers in this issue are the culmination of this 6-month challenge, and demonstrate that data integration and multidisciplinary collaboration can indeed yield novel approaches for handling large, complex datasets, and reveal new insight and relevance to a complex illness such as CFS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.2217/14622416.7.3.345,"Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Autonomic Nervous System/physiopathology;Body Mass Index;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Depressive Disorder, Major/physiopathology;Diagnostic Techniques, Neurological;Fatigue/physiopathology/psychology;Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*genetics;Female;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiopathology;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Selection;Pituitary-Adrenal System/physiopathology;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Research Subjects;Sleep/physiology;Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic;Fatigue",16610945,

We studied hypothalamic gene expression in rats treated with SJW or IMI to test the hypothesis that chronic antidepressant treatment by various classes of drugs results in shared patterns of gene expression that may underlie their therapeutic effects. Individual hypothalami were hybridized to individual Affymetrix chips; we studied three arrays per group treatment. We constructed 95% confidence intervals for expression fold change for genes present in at least one treatment condition and we considered genes to be differentially expressed if they had a confidence interval excluding 1 (or -1) and had absolute difference in expression value of 10 or greater. SJW treatment differentially regulated 66 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs) and IMI treatment differentially regulated 74 genes and ESTs. We found six common transcripts in response to both treatments. The likelihood of this occurring by chance is 1.14 x 10(-23). These transcripts are relevant to two molecular machines, namely the ribosomes and microtubules, and one cellular organelle, the mitochondria.

We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human orthologs of genes regulated both treatments, as those genes may be novel candidates for pharmacogenetic studies.

It is known that the metabolism of important neuroleptic drugs is influenced by polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene, which encodes the cytochrome P450 enzyme debrisoquine/spartein hydroxylase. Forty-five patients meeting the DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia, chronic course, were recruited. The patients were examined for the mutations CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*5. The CYP2D6 genotype distribution in the patient group did not differ from that in healthy Caucasian populations. Tardive dyskinesia was found in 26 patients (57.8%). When comparing patients without CYP2D6 mutations with patients heterozygous for one mutation, we found a higher incidence of TD in the latter (81.3% vs. 46.4%, p = 0.031, multiple regression analysis), which demonstrates a significant influence of the CYP2D6 genotype of the manifestation of TD. As slight differences in the metabolism of drugs in patients heterozygous for CYP2D6 mutations and patients without such mutations are known, we conclude that heterozygous carriers of 2D6 mutated alleles may show an increased susceptibility to developing TD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/s0920-9964(98)00038-3,"Adult;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*metabolism;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/*genetics;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy/*genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Schizophrenia;Polymorphism, Genetic;Movement Disorders",9713905,

In this study, a novel polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was developed to determine the C to A single nucleotide polymorphism at position 267 in the CHRM1 gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new reverse primer and a mismatched forward primer were designed to obtain 125 bp PCR products. The PCR products were then digested with the Hae III restriction enzyme to detect the rs2067477 polymorphism that comprises a C to A base change. The novel assay developed was tested in 51 Turkish schizophrenia patients. RESULTS: The genotyping assay was successfully performed in patients with schizophrenia in order to confirm the accuracy and validity of this method. The frequency of CC, CA, and AA genotypes was 72.5%, 25.5%, and 2%, respectively. On the basis of these findings, the allele frequency of C was 0.85 and the allele frequency of A was 0.15. CONCLUSION: This genotyping assay is practical for screening the CHRM1 C267A polymorphism in pharmacogenetic studies. The present polymorphism may be used as a candidate biomarker to determine genetic susceptibility to related diseases and may contribute to the implementation of individualized drug therapy for M1-related diseases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.4274/tjps.galenos.2019.46793,"Genotype;Receptors, Muscarinic",33389966,PMC7786075

A genetic association has been shown between HTR4 and susceptibility to mood disorders. Our study aims at assessing the association between the HTR4 genetic polymorphism, rs1345697, and improvement in depressive symptoms and remission after antidepressant treatment in MDE patients. METHODS: 492 depressed patients from the METADAP cohort were treated prospectively for 6 months with ADs. The clinical outcomes according to HTR4 rs1345697 were compared after 1 (M1), 3 (M3), and 6 (M6) months of treatment. Mixed-effects logistic regression and adjusted linear models assessed the association between rs1345697 and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score improvement and response/remission. RESULTS: Over the 6 months of treatment, mixed-effects regressions showed lower improvements in HDRS scores (Coefficient=1.52; Confident Interval (CI) 95% [0.37-2.67]; p = 0.009) and lower remission rates (Odds Ratio=2.0; CI95% [1.0-4.1]; p = 0.05) in GG homozygous patients as compared to allele A carriers. LIMITATIONS: The major limitations of our study are the uncertainty of the rs1345697 effect on HTR4 function, the substantial drop-out rate, and the fact that analysis is not based on randomization between polymorphism groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, patients who were homozygous carriers of the variant G of the HTR4 rs1345697 had lower depressive symptoms improvement and 2-fold lower remission rates after antidepressant treatment as compared to allele A carriers.

Certain antipsychotic drugs, e.g. risperidone, are more likely to induce HPRL because of relative accumulation within the adenohypophysis. Nevertheless, due to competition for pituitary DRD2s by high dopamine levels may limit antipsychotic-induced HPRL. Moreover, the activity of prolactin-producing lactotrophs also depends on other hormones which are regulated by the extra-pituitary activity of dopamine receptors, dopamine transporters, enzymes of neurotransmitter metabolism and other factors. Polymorphic variants in the genes coding for these receptors and proteins can have functional significance and influence on the development of hyperprolactinemia. METHODS: A set of 41 SNPs of genes for dopamine receptors DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, the dopamine transporter SLC6A3 and dopamine catabolizing enzymes MAOA and MAOB was investigated in a population of 446 Caucasians (221 males/225 females) with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (according to ICD-10: F20) with and without HPRL who were treated with classical and/or atypical antipsychotic drugs. Additive genetic model was tested and the analysis was carried out in the total group and in subgroup stratified by the use of risperidone/paliperidone. RESULTS: One statistically significant association between polymorphic variant rs1799836 of MAOB gene and HPRL in men was found in the total group. Furthermore, the rs40184 and rs3863145 variants in SLC6A3 gene appeared to be associated with HPRL in the subgroup of patients using the risperidone/paliperidone, but not with HPRL induced by other antipsychotic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that genetic variants of MAOB and SLC6A3 may have consequences on the modulation of prolactin secretion.

A meta-analysis of rs6295, a functional polymorphism located at the promoter region of HTR1A, showed association with clinical response in schizophrenic patients treated with atypical APD. We have now tested whether other SNPs related to rs6295 predict response to lurasidone. We first evaluated whether rs358532 and rs6449693, tag SNPs for rs6295, predicted response to lurasidone, using data from two clinical trials of acutely psychotic schizophrenia patients with European (EUR, n = 171) or African (AFR, n = 131) ancestry; we then determined if those findings could be replicated in a third trial of lurasidone of similar design. Weekly changes (up to 6 weeks) in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total score and its five subscales were used to assess response. In EUR, a significant association, or trends for association, were observed for PANSS Total (p = 0.035), positive (p = 0.039), negative (p = 0.004), and disorganization (p = 0.0087) subscales, at week 1-6. There was a trend for replication with PANNS Total (p = 0.036) in the third trial. No significant association was observed in AFR or the placebo group. Meta-analysis of five studies, including the three with lurasidone, showed that rs6295 was associated with improvement in positive (p = 0.023) and negative (p ≤ 0.0001) symptoms in EUR patients with schizophrenia. This is the first study to show a significant association between functional HTR1A polymorphisms and treatment response to lurasidone.

Ninety-four patients of Caucasian descent with major depressive disorder (MDD) (f = 61) were analysed for DNA methylation status at nine CpG sites in the 5-HTT transcriptional control region upstream of exon 1A via direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite treated DNA extracted from blood cells. Patients were also genotyped for the functional 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphisms. Clinical response to treatment with escitalopram was assessed by intra-individual changes of HAM-D-21 scores after 6 wk of treatment. Lower average 5-HTT methylation across all nine CpGs was found to be associated with impaired antidepressant treatment response after 6 wk (p = 0.005). This effect was particularly conferred by one individual 5-HTT CpG site (CpG2 (GRCh37 build, NC_000017.10 28.563.102; p = 0.002). 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 haplotype was neither associated with 5-HTT DNA methylation nor treatment response. This analysis suggests that DNA hypomethylation of the 5-HTT transcriptional control region - possibly via increased serotonin transporter expression and consecutively decreased serotonin availability - might impair antidepressant treatment response in Caucasian patients with MDD.

Shorter telomeres in psychiatric patients are thought to be the consequence of allostatic load, consisting in the overactivation of allostatic systems due to chronic exposure to severe medical conditions and failure to adapt to chronic stressful stimuli. Most of the studies on telomere length in psychiatry have focused on major depressive disorder, but recent findings have shown shorter leukocyte telomere length in bipolar disorder patients and suggested that lithium may counteract telomeres shortening. These findings provided new insights into the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and the mechanism of action of lithium. In this review we will present findings from the literature on telomere length in bipolar disorder, with a specific focus on lithium. We will also discuss advances and limitations of published work as well as methodological issues and potential confounding factors that should be taken into account when designing research protocols to study telomere length.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.10.008,Bipolar Disorder/*blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy;Humans;Lithium/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Telomere/drug effects/physiology;Telomere Homeostasis/*drug effects/*physiology;Telomere Shortening/drug effects/physiology;Treatment Outcome;Bipolar Disorder;Lithium;Telomere,26621262,

The present study was therefore designed to examine whether polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene are related to therapeutic response. For this purpose, 130 Chinese schizophrenia patients undergoing risperidone treatment were recruited. Plasma drug concentrations were monitored and clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) before and 8 weeks after the treatment. Association tests between genotypes and percentage improvement in total BPRS scores were performed using analyses of variance. Our results show that genotyping C1236T may help to predict the efficacy of risperidone treatment on the basis that patients with the TT genotype showed greater improvement than those with other genotypes on the overall BPRS (F = 3.967, p = 0.021), while other polymorphisms, including rs13233308, G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphism, did not show any association with the response to risperidone.

Thus, we investigated whether variants in the genes encoding interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, and IL-6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met are associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). METHODS: Nineteen polymorphisms were genotyped using Taqman(®) assays in 188 schizophrenia patients on antipsychotic treatment for up to 14 weeks. Mean weight change (%) from baseline was compared across genotypic groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Epistatic effects between cytokine polymorphisms and BDNF Val66Met were tested using Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction. RESULTS: In European patients, IL-1β rs16944*GA (P = 0.013, Pcorrected = 0.182), IL-1β rs1143634*G (P = 0.001, Pcorrected = 0.014), and BDNF Val66Met (Val/Val, P = 0.004, Pcorrected = 0.056) were associated with greater AIWG, as were IL-1β rs4849127*A (P = 0.049, Pcorrected = 0.784), and IL-1β rs16944*GA (P = 0.012, Pcorrected = 0.192) in African Americans.

KCNH2 has also been associated with schizophrenia risk, and risk alleles predict increased expression of a brain-selective isoform, KCNH2 3.1, that has unique physiological properties. The authors assessed whether genetic variation associated with KCNH2 3.1 expression influences the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: The authors performed a pharmacogenetic analysis of antipsychotic treatment response in patients with schizophrenia using data from two independent studies: a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient crossover trial (N=54) and the multicenter outpatient Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study (N=364). The KCNH2 genotype that was previously associated with increased expression of KCNH2 3.1 in the brain was treated as a predictor variable. Treatment-associated changes in symptoms were evaluated in both groups with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The authors also analyzed time to discontinuation in the olanzapine arm of the CATIE study. RESULTS: In the NIMH study, individuals who were homozygous for the KCNH2 3.1 increased expression-associated T allele of rs1036145 showed significant improvement in positive symptoms, general psychopathology, and thought disturbance, while patients with other genotypes showed little change. In the CATIE study, analogous significant genotypic effects were observed. Moreover, individuals who were homozygous for the T allele at rs1036145 were one-fifth as likely to discontinue olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: These consistent findings in two markedly different treatment studies support the hypothesis that hERG1-mediated effects of antipsychotics may not be limited to their potential cardiovascular side effects but may also involve therapeutic actions related to the brainspecific 3.1 isoform of KCNH2.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.11081214,Adult;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data;ERG1 Potassium Channel;Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels/*genetics;Female;Genetic Variation/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics;Male;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Genetic Variation;Brain;Schizophrenia,22706279,

In this study we used next generation sequencing to measure genome-wide miRNA expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from BD patients excellent responders (ER, n = 12) and non-responders (NR, n = 12) to lithium. These data were integrated with microarray genome-wide expression data to identify pairs of miRNA/mRNA inversely and significantly correlated.

Thirty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed in ER vs. NR and inversely correlated with 418 genes differentially expressed between the two groups. A total of 331 of these correlations were also predicted by in-silico algorithms. miR-320a and miR-155-3p, as well as three of their targeted genes (CAPNS1 (Calpain Small Subunit 1) and RGS16 (Regulator of G Protein Signaling 16) for miR-320, SP4 (Sp4 Transcription Factor) for miR-155-3p) were validated. These miRNAs and mRNAs were previously implicated in psychiatric disorders (miR-320a and SP4), key processes of the central nervous system (CAPNS1, RGS16, SP4) or pathways involved in mental illnesses (miR-155-3p).

Research exploring the mechanism of this phenomenon, however, has been extremely limited. Considering the indirect evidence of genetic control and difficulties in developing animal models and performing gene expression studies, genetic association studies could be an important approach to understanding the molecular mechanism of AAP-induced OC symptoms. The glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1, which was recently reported to be associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is a promising candidate gene for susceptibility to AAP-induced OC symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether polymorphisms in SLC1A1 are associated with AAP-induced OC symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN: A pharmacogenetic case-control association study. SETTING: Outpatient schizophrenia clinics. PATIENTS: Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia who were receiving AAP treatment (n = 94; OC group). The OC group consisted of 40 patients with AAP-induced OC symptoms, and the non-OC group consisted of 54 patients who had received AAP for more than 24 months without developing OC symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies. The association was tested with a logistic regression model using age, sex, and medication type as covariates. RESULTS: Trends of association were observed in rs2228622 and rs3780412 (nominal P = .01; adjusted permutation P = .07) for the dominant model that was the inheritance model that best fit our data. In the haplotype -based analysis, the A/C/G haplotype at rs2228622-rs3780413-rs3780412 showed a significant association with AAP-induced OC symptoms; this association withstood multiple test correction (nominal P = .01; adjusted permutation P = .04; odds ratio, 3.955; 95% confidence interval, 1.366-11.452, for dominant model). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sequence variations in SLC1A1 are associated with susceptibility to AAP-induced OC symptoms.

Emerging data indicates that DNAm could be used as a predictor of drug response for psychiatric disorders. In this study, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the reproducibility of published changes of drug response-related DNAm in SCZ, BD and MDD. A total of 37 publications were included. Since the studies involved patients of different treatment stages, we partitioned them into three groups based on their primary focuses: (1) medication-induced DNAm changes (n = 8); (2) the relationship between DNAm and clinical improvement (n = 24); and (3) comparison of DNAm status across different medications (n = 14). We found that only BDNF was consistent with the DNAm changes detected in four independent studies for MDD. It was positively correlated with clinical improvement in MDD. To develop better predictive DNAm factors for drug response, we also discussed future research strategies, including experimental, analytical procedures and statistical criteria. Our review shows promising possibilities for using BDNF DNAm as a predictor of antidepressant treatment response for MDD, while more pharmacoepigenetic studies are needed for treatments of various diseases.

However, the medical sciences literature lacks a comprehensive association between sedation and somnolence among a wide-range of antipsychotic compounds. The objective of this study is to assess the disproportionality of sedation and somnolence among thirty-seven typical and atypical antipsychotics. Materials and Methods: Patient adverse drug reactions (ADR) cases were obtained from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) between January 01, 2004 and September 30, 2020 for a wide-array of clinical indications and off-label use of antipsychotics. An assessment of disproportionality were based on cases of sedation and somnolence and calculated using the case/non-case methodology. Statistical analysis resulting in the reporting odds-ratio (ROR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were conducted using the R statistical programming language. Results: Throughout the reporting period, there were a total of 9,373,236 cases with 99,251 specific ADRs reporting sedation and somnolence. Zuclopenthixol (n = 224) ROR = 13.3 (95% CI, 11.6-15.3) was most strongly associated of sedation and somnolence and haloperidol decanoate long-acting injection (LAI) was not statistically associated sedation and somnolence. Further, among atypical antipsychotic compounds, tiapride and asenapine were the top two compounds most strongly associated with sedation and somnolence. Comprehensively, the typical antipsychotics ROR = 5.05 (95%CI, 4.97-5.12) had a stronger association with sedation and somnolence when compared to atypical antipsychotics ROR = 4.65 (95%CI, 4.47-4.84). Conclusion: We conducted a head-to-head comparison of thirty-seven antipsychotics and ranked the compounds based on the association of sedation and somnolence from ADR data collected throughout 16 years from the FAERS. The results are informative and with recent interests in repurposing phenothiazine antipsychotics in infectious disease and oncology provides an informative assessment of the compounds during repurposing and in psychopharmacology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.3389/fphar.2021.621691,"Bipolar Disorder;Child Development Disorders, Pervasive;Autistic Disorder;Schizophrenia;Communicable Diseases",33841149,PMC8027114

The large number of detected loci, chief among them TRPM8, PRDM16, and LRP1, have enabled a number of in silico analyses, which have shed light on the functional and tissue-level aspects of the common risk variants for migraine, including evidence for involvement of both vascular and neuronal mechanisms.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between genes of the dopamine receptors (D1, D2, and D3) and the effect of risperidone treatment. METHODS: Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant cohort or case-control studies published before 9 May 2018. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the relationship between the dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 (DRD1, 2, and 3) and the effect of risperidone treatment. The summary odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) in a random-effects model were used to measure these relationships. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 24 SNPs were included. DRD2 (Ser311Cys, rs1801028 Ser/Ser) significantly lowered the improvement rate (determined by the PANSS score) unlike Ser/Cys (WMD: -11.58, 95% CI: -17.35 to -5.18).

Increased stress reactivity and hyperactivity of the HPA axis seem characteristic for psychotic/melancholic depression, while the atypical subtype of depression has been connected with the opposing phenotypes. However, the underlying molecular-genetic mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, mouse lines selectively bred for extremes in stress reactivity (SR), i.e. presenting high (HR) or low (LR) corticosterone secretion in response to stressors, were used to characterise the molecular alterations on all levels of the HPA axis. Results were contrasted with clinical phenotypes of MD patients from the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature project, stratified according to their cortisol response in the Dex/CRH test. Distinct differences between HR and LR mice were found in the expression of HPA axis-related genes in the adrenals, pituitary and selected brain areas. Moreover, HR animals presented an enhanced adrenal sensitivity, increased stress-induced neuronal activation in the PVN and an overshooting Dex/CRH test response, whereas LR animals showed a blunted response in these paradigms. Interestingly, analogous neuroendocrine, morphometric, psychopathological and behavioural differences were observed between the respective high and low HPA axis responder groups of MD patients. Our findings suggests that (i) the SR mouse model can serve as a valuable tool to elucidate HPA axis-related mechanisms underlying affective disorders and (ii) a stratification of MD patients according to their HPA axis-related neuroendocrine function should be considered for clinical research and treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.07.008,"Adrenal Glands/drug effects/metabolism;Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism/pharmacology;Aldosterone/blood;Animals;Brain/metabolism/physiology;Corticosterone/metabolism;Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone;Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology;Dexamethasone;Disease Models, Animal;Endophenotypes/*metabolism;Female;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Hydrocortisone/blood;Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/metabolism;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred Strains;Middle Aged;Pituitary Gland/metabolism;Pituitary-Adrenal System/metabolism;Stress, Psychological/blood/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology;Translational Research, Biomedical",25123105,

However, its potential to induce remission of major depressive episodes, the optimal clinical target for an antidepressant drug, is a matter of concern. Indeed, only one out of four double-blind randomized controlled trials show higher remission rates with pioglitazone than with control treatments. Hence, the main aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the efficacy of pioglitazone for the treatment of MDE, focusing on remission rates. METHODS: Four double-blind randomized controlled trials, comprising 161 patients with an MDE, were included in this meta-analysis. Pioglitazone was studied either alone (one study) or as add-on therapy to conventional treatments (antidepressant drugs or lithium salts). It was compared either to placebo (three studies) or to metformin (one study). Remission was defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score <8 after treatment. RESULTS: Pioglitazone could induce higher remission rates than control treatments (27% versus 10%, I(2)=17.3%, fixed-effect model: odds ratio [OR] =3.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI; 1.4; 7.8], P=0.008).

As compared to control treatments, results suggest six patients would need to be treated with pioglitazone in order to achieve the possibility of one more remission. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone, either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional treatments, could induce remission of MDE, suggesting that drugs with PPAR-γ agonist properties may be true and clinically relevant antidepressants, even in patients without metabolic comorbidities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.2147/NDT.S121149,,28031713,PMC5182046

A functional polymorphism, rs6295, in the 5-HT1A-receptor gene (HTR1A) contributes to this variability in negative symptom response. The DNA sequence containing rs6295 is rich in cytosine methylation (CpG) sites; CpG methylation is an epigenetic factor that, like rs6295, can modify transcriptional control. To investigate whether DNA methylation influences response to antipsychotic treatment, we determined methylation at CpG sites close to rs6295 in DNA from 82 Chinese subjects with a first psychotic episode.

An effect of rs6295 on negative symptom response was not seen in this sample, which may not have provided sufficient power for the pharmacogenetic association.

Bacteria can pass through the gut barrier and be found in the blood. Using a multiomic approach, we investigated whether a distinct blood microbiome and metabolome was associated with major depressive episodes, and how it was modulated by treatment. METHODS: In this case-control multiomic study, we analyzed the blood microbiome composition, inferred bacterial functions and metabolomic profile of 56 patients experiencing a current major depressive episode and 56 matched healthy controls, before and after treatment, using 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The baseline blood microbiome in patients with a major depressive episode was distinct from that of healthy controls (patients with a major depressive episode had a higher proportion of Janthinobacterium and lower levels of Neisseria) and changed after antidepressant treatment. Predicted microbiome functions confirmed by metabolomic profiling showed that patients who were experiencing a major depressive episode had alterations in the cyanoamino acid pathway at baseline. High baseline levels of Firmicutes and low proportions of Bosea and Tetrasphaera were associated with response to antidepressant treatment. Based on inferred baseline metagenomic profiles, bacterial pathways that were significantly associated with treatment response were related to xenobiotics, amino acids, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, including tryptophan and drug metabolism. Metabolomic analyses showed that plasma tryptophan levels are independently associated with response to antidepressant treatment. LIMITATIONS: Our study has some limitations, including a lack of information on blood microbiome origin and the lack of a validation cohort to confirm our results. CONCLUSION: Patients with depression have a distinct blood microbiome and metabolomic signature that changes after treatment. Dysbiosis could be a new therapeutic target and prognostic tool for the treatment of patients who are experiencing a major depressive episode.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1503/jpn.200159,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Bacteria/classification/drug effects;Blood/drug effects/*microbiology;Brain-Gut Axis/*drug effects;Carbohydrate Metabolism/drug effects;Case-Control Studies;Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/complications/*drug therapy/*microbiology;Dysbiosis/blood/complications/metabolism/*microbiology;Female;Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects;Humans;Lipid Metabolism/drug effects;Male;Metabolome/*drug effects;Microbiota/*drug effects;Microbiota",34008933,PMC8327971

While the pathophysiology of AIWG remains poorly understood, numerous studies have reported a positive association between AIWG and the therapeutic benefit of antipsychotic medications. Objectives: To review the literature to (1) determine if AIWG is consistently associated with therapeutic benefit and (2) investigate which variables may mediate such an association. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles containing all the following exploded MESH terms: schizophrenia [AND] antipsychotic agents/neuroleptics [AND] (weight gain [OR] lipids [OR] insulin [OR] leptin) [AND] treatment outcome. Results were limited to full-text, English journal articles. Results: Our literature search uncovered 31 independent studies which investigated an AIWG-therapeutic benefit association with a total of 6063 enrolled individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or another serious mental illness receiving antipsychotic medications. Twenty-two studies found a positive association while, 10 studies found no association and one study reported a negative association. Study variables including medication compliance, sex, ethnicity, or prior antipsychotic exposure did not appear to consistently affect the AIWG-therapeutic benefit relationship. In contrast, there was some evidence that controlling for baseline BMI/psychopathology, duration of treatment and specific agent studied [i.e., olanzapine (OLZ) or clozapine (CLZ)] strengthened the relationship between AIWG and therapeutic benefit. Limitations: There were limitations of the reviewed studies in that many had small sample sizes, and/or were retrospective. The heterogeneity of the studies also made comparisons difficult and publication bias was not controlled for. Conclusions: An AIWG-therapeutic benefit association may exist and is most likely to be observed in OLZ and CLZ-treated patients. The clinical meaningfulness of this association remains unclear and weight gain and other metabolic comorbidities should be identified and treated to the same targets as the general population. Further research should continue to explore the links between therapeutic benefit and metabolic health with emphasis on both pre-clinical work and well-designed prospective clinical trials examining metabolic parameters associated, but also occurring independently to AIWG.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3389/fnins.2017.00741,Weight Gain;Antipsychotic Agents,29403343,PMC5786866

The genotypes for single nucleotide polymorphisms rs737865, rs4633, rs6267, rs4680 (Val 158 Met) and rs165599 were determined in 207 patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and 204 paired controls. Statistical tests for linkage disequilibrium and for case-control differences in haplotype frequencies were performed using log-linear modelling embedded within the expectation-maximization algorithm. P-values based on permutations were calculated using the software UNPHASED, and odds ratios were estimated using the SHEsis platform. The response to neuroleptic treatment was assessed by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale and the severity of psychotic symptoms by the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scale. The overall disease status was significantly associated with the T-G (Val) diplotype for rs4633-rs4680 (P=0.0049). A significant association was observed between schizophrenia, but not other related disorders, and genotypes GG (Val/Val) for rs4680 and TT for rs4633. Val/Val patients with schizophrenia showed a higher severity of the psychotic symptoms and a worse response to the neuroleptic treatment.

Due to the increasing use of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents, their metabolic and endocrine adverse effects are of particular concern especially within this pediatric population that appears to be at greater risk. Genetic factors with a possible influence on atypical antipsychotics adverse effects include CYP2D6 polymorphisms. Our study, performed in 2009-2014, with a two-year enrolment period during which we recruited children and adolescents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder on treatment with the antipsychotics (Risperidone, Aripiprazole or Olanzapine), included 81 patients, aged between 9 and 20 years, median age being 15.74 years. The gender percentage was 54% girls/46% boys. The CYP2D6 genotyping was performed after enrolment of the last patient. Based on the CYP2D6 genotype, three activity groups were identified and compared and we found that the patients with wt/*4 genotype, intermediary metabolizer (carrier of one functional and one non-functional allele) have significantly higher weight gain values than the patients who did not exhibit allele *4. The CYP2D6 genotype in children and adolescents with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, proved to be a good predictor for the response to atypical antipsychotics and the side effects registered. The significant correlations between the CYP2D6 polymorphisms and the weight gain/BMI (body mass index) increase, as major side effects induced by antipsychotics proved the fact that the pharmacogenetic screening is needed in the future clinical practice, allowing for individualized, tailored treatment, especially for at-risk individuals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",,Adolescent;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Bipolar Disorder/blood/drug therapy/genetics;Body Mass Index;Child;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Female;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Insulin/blood;Male;Schizophrenia/blood/drug therapy/genetics;Time Factors;Weight Gain/drug effects/*genetics;Young Adult;Antipsychotic Agents;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Weight Gain;Genotype,25329115,

While up to 60% of treated individuals obtain therapeutic benefits from clozapine, it is currently underprescribed worldwide, partly because of concerns related to its broad adverse effect profile. In particular, the potential effects of clozapine on the immune system have gained relevance after a recent study showed that drug plasma concentrations were inversely correlated with neutrophil counts in individuals routinely undergoing treatment. Seeking to investigate this relationship in more detail, we extracted metabolic, immune, and genetic data from a UK cohort of long-term clozapine users linked to a clozapine monitoring service, CLOZUK2 (N = 208). Whilst a correlation analysis was compatible with the original results, a multiple linear regression accounting for dose and other confounding factors additionally allowed us to estimate the decrease in absolute neutrophil counts to approximately 141 cells/mm(3) for every 0.1 mg/L increase in clozapine concentration. However, this association was attenuated after controlling for the metabolic ratio between clozapine and its main metabolite, norclozapine, which was itself negatively associated with neutrophil concentrations. Further analyses revealed that these relationships are likely moderated by genetic factors, as three pharmacogenomic SNPs previously associated to norclozapine plasma concentrations and the metabolic ratio (rs61750900, rs2011425 and rs1126545) were shown to be independently associated with a variation in neutrophil counts of about 400 cells/mm(3) per effect allele. Such results are compatible with an effect of norclozapine, but not necessarily clozapine, on immune cell counts, and highlight the need for further investigations into the potential role of genetic determinants of clozapine pharmacokinetics in the occurrence of adverse effects during treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fphar.2021.658734,Schizophrenia;Clozapine,33959025,PMC8094024

Escitalopram is metabolized by CYP2D6, and recent studies have reported a correlation between clinical outcomes and CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the CYP2D6 P34S polymorphism (C188T, rs1065852) and the efficacy of escitalopram treatment in Korean patients with MDD. METHODS: A total of 94 patients diagnosed with MDD were recruited for the study and their symptoms were evaluated using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD-21). The association between the CYP2D6 P34S polymorphism and the clinical outcomes (remission and response) was investigated after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of escitalopram treatment using multiple logistic regression analysis and χ(2) test. RESULTS: The proportion of P allele carriers (PP, PS) in remission status was greater than that of S allele homozygotes (SS) after 8 and 12 weeks of escitalopram treatment. Similarly, P allele carriers exhibited a greater treatment response after 8 and 12 weeks of escitalopram treatment than S allele homozygotes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the P allele of the CYP2D6 P34S polymorphism is a favorable factor in escitalopram treatment for MDD, and that the CYP2D6 P34S polymorphism may be a good genetic marker for predicting escitalopram treatment outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.4306/pi.2013.10.3.286,"Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Polymorphism, Genetic;Citalopram",24302953,PMC3843022

In exposed individuals, and in their descendants, adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure, including cancers, genital malformations, and less consistently, psychiatric disorders. We aimed to explore whether prenatal DES exposure would be associated with DNA methylation changes, and whether these epigenetic modifications would be associated with increased risk of psychosis. METHODS: From 247 individuals born from mothers exposed to DES, we selected 69 siblings from 30 families. In each family, at least one sibling was exposed in utero to DES. We performed a methylome-wide association study using HumanMethylation450 DNA Analysis BeadChip® in peripheral blood. We analyzed methylation changes at individual CpGs or regions in exposed (n = 37) versus unexposed individuals (n = 32). We also compared exposed individuals with (n = 7) and without psychosis (n = 30). RESULTS: There were more individuals with schizophrenia in the DES-exposed group. We found no significant differences between exposed and unexposed individuals with respect to differentially methylated CpGs or regions. The largest difference was in a region near the promoter of an ADAMTS proteoglycanase gene (ADAMTS9). Compared to exposed individuals without psychosis, exposed individuals with psychosis had differential methylation in the region encompassing the gene encoding the zinc finger protein 57 (ZFP57). CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure to DES was not associated with methylation changes at specific CpG or regions. In exposed individuals, however, psychosis was associated with specific methylomic modifications that could impact neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0174783,"ADAMTS9 Protein/metabolism;Adult;CpG Islands;*DNA Methylation;DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism;Diethylstilbestrol/*toxicity;*Epigenesis, Genetic;Female;Humans;Male;Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects;Pregnancy;Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/*metabolism/physiopathology;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Psychotic Disorders/etiology/*metabolism;Repressor Proteins;Transcription Factors/metabolism;Diethylstilbestrol;Psychotic Disorders",28406917,PMC5390994

We believe we performed the first longitudinal prospective study of genomic DNA methylation during psychotic transition in help-seeking young individuals referred to a specialized outpatient unit for early detection of psychosis and enrolled in a 1-year follow-up. We used Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array after bisulfite conversion and analyzed longitudinal variations in methylation at 411 947 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites. Conversion to psychosis was associated with specific methylation changes. Changes in DNA methylation were significantly different between converters and non-converters in two regions: one located in 1q21.1 and a cluster of six CpG located in GSTM5 gene promoter. Methylation data were confirmed by pyrosequencing in the same population. The 100 top CpGs associated with conversion to psychosis were subjected to exploratory analyses regarding the related gene networks and their capacity to distinguish between converters and non-converters. Cluster analysis showed that the top CpG sites correctly distinguished between converters and non-converters. In this first study of methylation during conversion to psychosis, we found that alterations preferentially occurred in gene promoters and pathways relevant for psychosis, including oxidative stress regulation, axon guidance and inflammatory pathways. Although independent replications are warranted to reach definitive conclusions, these results already support that longitudinal variations in DNA methylation may reflect the biological mechanisms that precipitate some prodromal individuals into full-blown psychosis, under the influence of environmental factors and maturational processes at adolescence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/mp.2016.53,"Adolescent;CpG Islands/genetics;DNA Methylation;Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics;Epigenomics/methods;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Glutathione Transferase/genetics;Humans;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics;Prospective Studies;Psychotic Disorders/*genetics/*metabolism;Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods;Young Adult;Psychotic Disorders",27113994,PMC5378806

This study aims to investigate the possible association of PRSs for bipolar disorder, MDD, neuroticism, and schizophrenia (SCZ) with antidepressant non-response or non-remission in patients with MDD. PRSs were calculated at eight genome-wide P-thresholds based on publicly available summary statistics of the largest genome-wide association studies. Logistic regressions were performed between PRSs and non-response or non-remission in six European clinical samples, adjusting for age, sex, baseline symptom severity, recruitment sites, and population stratification. Results were meta-analysed across samples, including up to 3,637 individuals. Bonferroni correction was applied. In the meta-analysis, no result was significant after Bonferroni correction.

Over the past 10 years, clozapine has become the reference compound for the development of new antipsychotics, and new drugs have been developed which have also claimed atypical status. The indications of clozapine were recently extended to Psychosis in Parkinson's disease and harmonized in the European Union. This provides the opportunity to update the data on clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia. In this article we review current clinical evidence in schizophrenia to address the following issues: 1) Efficacy in refractory/positive symptoms: a systematic and critical analysis of 14 double-blind clinical trials in comparison with both standard and novel antipsychotics show consistent findings in favour of clozapine, with all but three of the reports demonstrating superiority. The review of studies allow us to say little about the predictors of treatment response, time to clozapine response and about the impact of clozapine on the quality of patients'life and longer-term outcome. Treatment options for clozapine non-responders are reviewed. 2) Risk of EPS: clozapine is considered to have a minimal risk of EPS and in all studies where a valid methodology was used, a clear superiority over the other neuroleptics is demonstrated. It is pointed out that, if the prevalence and incidence of EPS with clozapine is low, it is not zero. All the studies assessing clozapine treatment for TD have major methodological limitations, so no final conclusion can be drawn. 3) Efficacy for primary and secondary negative symptoms and neurocognitive effects: the data of clinical studies where negative symptoms scales were used favour clozapine in terms of improvement. However most of the studies were carried out in populations with predominantly positive symptoms. With regard to the need to distinguish primary and secondary symptoms, data are conflicting regarding the benefit of clozapine. Due to the lack of studies with a valid methodology, no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the efficacy on clozapine on the deficit syndrome and on neurocognitive disorders. 4) Impact on suicide risk: 4 out of 6 retrospective studies provide evidence for the ability of clozapine therapy to reduce suicidal behaviour. The results of a recent randomized, parallel-group study designed to compare clozapine versus olanzapine in preventing suicide attempts seems to confirm this hypothesis. We also address the tolerability and safety data, especially haematologic, comitial, cardiovascular and metabolic side-effects. The effectiveness of blood monitoring for the management of neutropenia and agranulocytosis demands that the recommendations are strictly followed. The use of clozapine at doses higher than 600 mg daily should follow published recommendations, in order to minimize the risk of seizures; these include anticonvulsant regimens based on blood levels. With regard to the cardiovascular mortality, if clozapine therapy has negligible effects on QT interval, its association with potential fatal myocarditis cannot be excluded in young patients who should be investigated if they develop cardiac symptoms in the first weeks of treatment. Available data support the notion that the frequency of bodyweight gain is high with several new antipsychotics, including clozapine. Potential long term effects of bodyweight gain on mortality and morbidity have to be taken into consideration. The pharmacological mechanisms underlying the ""unique clozapine profile"" is discussed. Clozapine remains the only antipsychotic with efficacy at relatively low D2 receptor occupancy. The pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic aspects are also reviewed. Finally, the place of clozapine in the current treatment of schizophrenia is highlighted to inform the development of guidelines for clinical management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",10.1016/s0013-7006(04)95462-0,Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;Clozapine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Humans;Schizophrenia/diagnosis/*drug therapy;Suicide/statistics & numerical data;Clozapine,15627052,

Numerous genes were differentially regulated in response to VPA (log(2) fold change ≥ 1.0; i.e., odds ratio of ≥2, at false discovery rate <5%), but only two genes ( Dynlrb2 and Cdyl2) showed significant differential regulation after exposure of the cells to lithium, with the same analysis criteria. Both of these genes were also regulated by VPA. Many of the differentially expressed genes had functions of potential relevance to mood disorders or their treatment, such as several serpin family genes (including neuroserpin), Nts (neurotensin), Maob (monoamine oxidase B), and Ap2b1, which is important for synaptic vesicle function.

AIMS: This analysis investigated the pharmacokinetic profiles of risperidone and 9-hydroxy (OH)-risperidone, and how these related to treatment-emergent extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), using data from The Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness in Alzheimer's Disease study (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00015548). METHOD: A statistical model, which described the concentration-time course of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone, was used to predict peak, trough and average concentrations of risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and 'active moiety' (combined concentrations) (n = 108 participants). Logistic regression was used to investigate the associations of pharmacokinetic biomarkers with EPS. Model-based predictions were used to simulate the dose adjustments needed to avoid EPS. RESULTS: The model showed an age-related reduction in risperidone clearance (P < 0.0001), reduced renal elimination of 9-OH-risperidone (elimination half-life 27 h), and slower active moiety clearance in 22% of patients, (concentration-to-dose ratio: 20.2 (s.d. = 7.2) v. 7.6 (s.d. = 4.9) ng/mL per mg/day, Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.0001). Higher trough 9-OH-risperidone and active moiety concentrations (P < 0.0001) and lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (P < 0.0001), were associated with EPS. Model-based predictions suggest the optimum dose ranged from 0.25 mg/day (85 years, MMSE of 5), to 1 mg/day (75 years, MMSE of 15), with alternate day dosing required for those with slower drug clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings argue for age- and MMSE-related dose adjustments and suggest that a single measure of the concentration-to-dose ratio could be used to identify those with slower drug clearance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1192/bjp.2020.225,Aggression;*Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy;*Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects;Humans;*Psychotic Disorders/complications/drug therapy;Risperidone/adverse effects;Alzheimer Disease;Risperidone,33176899,

We didn't reveal a statistical significance for concentration/dose indicator of mirtazapine in patients with different genotypes: (GG) 0.229 [0.158; 0.468] and (GA) 0.290 [0.174; 0.526], p = 0.196. Analysis of the results of the pharmacotranscriptomic part of the study didn't demonstrate the statistically significant difference in the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma levels in patients with different genotypes: (GG) 23.6 [17.6; 28.0], (GA) 21.8 [17.2; 27.0], p = 0.663. At the same time, correlation analysis didn't reveal a statistically significant relationship between the mirtazapine efficacy profile evaluated by changes in HAMD scale scores and the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration: rs = 0.05, p = 0.460. Also, we didn't reveal the correlation between the miRNA concentration and safety profile: rs = 0.11, p = 0.124. In addition, we revealed the relationship between the CYP2D6 enzymatic activity (as evaluated by 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration: rs = -0.32, p < 0.001. At the same time, correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between the mirtazapine concentration and the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration: rs = 0.31, p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Thus, the effect of genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the efficacy and safety profiles of mirtazapine was demonstrated in a group of 192 patients with recurrent depressive disorder. At the same time, hsa-miR-370-3p remains a promising biomarker for assessing the level of CYP2D6 expression, because it correlates with encoded isoenzyme activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",,"Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Humans;*MicroRNAs/genetics;Mirtazapine/*pharmacokinetics;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6",32733112,PMC7377541

Nineteen patients aged at least 80 years with a new diagnosis of MDD were monitored for response to citalopram 20 mg daily over 4 weeks and genotyped for the rs6295 allele. Both a frequentist and Bayesian analysis was performed on the data. Bayesian analysis answered the clinically relevant question: 'What is the probability that an older patient would enter remission after commencing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, conditional on their rs6295 genotype?' Individuals with a CC (cytosine-cytosine) genotype showed a significant improvement in their Geriatric Depression Score (p = 0.020) and cognition (p = 0.035) compared with other genotypes. From a Bayesian perspective, we updated reports of antidepressant efficacy in older people with our data and calculated that the 4-week relative risk of entering remission, given a CC genotype, is 1.9 [95% highest-density interval (HDI) 0.7-3.5], compared with 0.52 (95% HDI 0.1-1.0) for the CG (cytosine-guanine) genotype. The sample size of n = 19 is too small to draw any firm conclusions, however, the data suggest a trend indicative of a relationship between the rs6295 genotype and response to citalopram in older patients, which requires further investigation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1177/2042098618770620,"Aged, 80 and over;Citalopram;Polymorphism, Genetic",30034777,PMC6048630

We selected 168 European-Caucasian individuals from the CATIE sample based upon meeting criteria of multiple weight measures while taking selected antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine or olanzapine). We tested the association of 670 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes with weight change (%) using MAGMA software. Thirty of these genes showed nominally significant P-values (<0.05). We were able to replicate the association of three genes, CLPB, PARL, and ACAD10, with weight change (%) in an independent prospectively assessed AIWG sample. We analyzed mtDNA variants in a subset of 74 of these individuals using next-generation sequencing. No common or rare mtDNA variants were found to be significantly associated with weight change (%) in our sample. Additionally, analysis of mitochondrial haplogroups showed no association with weight change (%). In conclusion, our findings suggest nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes play a role in AIWG.

We therefore postulated that the Ser9Gly polymorphism might be in linkage disequilibrium with an undetected variant that exerts a direct influence on risperidone efficacy. The present study genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the DRD3 gene and examined five of these for association with treatment outcome, following an 8-week period of risperidone monotherapy in 130 schizophrenic patients from mainland China. Clinical symptoms were assessed before and after the treatment period, using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS). The confounding effects of non-genetic factors were estimated and the baseline symptom score was included as a covariate for adjustment. Neither was any association observed between the five polymorphisms and improvement in total BPRS scores nor was any combined effect of these variants detected in the haplotype analysis.

The PRS for schizophrenia was significantly increased in the affected individuals group, compared to their unaffected relatives. Last, we were also able to provide pharmacogenomics information based on CYP2D6 genotype data for most participants, and determine their antipsychotic metabolizer status.

Recently, intranasal esketamine has been approved by both the American Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for TRD and, more recently, in moderate to severe episode of MDD, as acute short-term treatment for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, which, according to clinical judgement, constitute a psychiatric emergency. There is currently no indication for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) although recently published studies have already shown a rapid and significant reduction of OCD-like symptoms following ketamine administration. The etiology of OCD has not yet been fully elucidated but there is a growing evidence that glutamate signaling dysfunction in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry plays an essential role. This case report exemplifies possible clinical effects of esketamine on both depressive and OCD symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 39-year-old man suffering from TRD. During the first evaluation at our clinic, he also reported the presence of OCD spectrum symptoms, causing him to perform time-consuming mental rituals due to pathological doubts regarding the relationship with his wife as well as intrusive thoughts regarding his mental conditions. He underwent psychometric evaluations, therapeutic drug monitoring analysis, and pharmacogenomic tests. The overall results helped to explain patient's treatment-resistance. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in both depressive and OCD symptoms after administration of esketamine. CONCLUSION: This case underlines the importance of pharmacogenomic tests in profiling TRD patients and confirms the possible use of esketamine in the treatment of comorbid OCD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: case report",10.1186/s12991-021-00365-z,Comorbidity;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Pharmacogenetics,34530843,PMC8444432

Leading the way have been genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have assessed common genetic markers across very large groups of patients and controls. These have resulted in findings in genes including ANK3, CACNA1C, SYNE1, ODZ4, and TRANK1. Additional studies have begun to examine the biology of these genes and how risk variants influence aspects of brain and behavior that underlie BPD. For example, carriers of the CACNA1C risk variant have been found to exhibit hippocampal and anterior cingulate dysfunction during episodic memory recall. This work has shed additional light on the relationship of bipolar susceptibility variants to other disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Even larger BPD GWAS are expected with samples now amassed of 21,035 cases and 28,758 controls. Studies have examined the pharmacogenomics of BPD with studies of lithium response, yielding high profile results that remain to be confirmed. The next frontier in the field is the identification of rare bipolar susceptibility variants through large-scale DNA sequencing. While only a couple of papers have been published to date, many studies are underway. The Bipolar Sequencing Consortium has been formed to bring together all of the groups working in this area, and to perform meta-analyses of the data generated. The consortium, with 13 member groups, now has exome data on ~3,500 cases and ~5,000 controls, and on ~162 families. The focus will likely shift within several years from exome data to whole genome data as costs of obtaining such data continue to drop. Gene-mapping studies are now providing clear results that provide insights into the pathophysiology of the disorder. Sequencing studies should extend this process further.

Its use has been limited due to adverse effects, which include weight gain and new-onset diabetes, but the incidence of these varies between patients. METHODS: We investigated 187 Clozapine Clinic patients (of whom 137 consented for genotyping) for the presence of CYP2C19*17 and its association with CZ and norclozapine (NCZ) levels, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent of genotyped patients were carriers of the CYP2C 19*17 polymorphism. This group demonstrated significantly higher NCZ serum levels, and significantly lower fasting glucose (5.66 ± 1.19 vs 6.72 ± 3.01 mmol/l, P = 0.009) and Hb1Ac (35.36 ± 4.78 vs 49.40 ± 20.60 mmol/mol, P = 0.006) levels compared to non-carriers of this polymorphism. CZ-treated patients with CYP2C19*17/*17 had a significantly lower prevalence of diabetes as well as a higher likelihood of clinical improvement of their schizophrenia, compared to those without this polymorphism (P = 0.012 and P = 0.031, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CYP2C19*17 ultra-rapid-metaboliser status is a protective factor against the development of diabetes during clozapine treatment, and increases the likelihood of improvement in schizophrenia.

We investigated whether upregulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) underlies the insulin resistance that develops during treatment with the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine. Olanzapine monotherapy increased BMI and circulating insulin, triglyceride, and MIF concentrations in drug-naive schizophrenic patients with normal MIF expression, but not in genotypic low MIF expressers. Olanzapine administration to mice increased their food intake and hypothalamic MIF expression, which led to activation of the appetite-related AMP-activated protein kinase and Agouti-related protein pathway. Olanzapine also upregulated MIF expression in adipose tissue, which reduced lipolysis and increased lipogenic pathways. Increased plasma lipid concentrations were associated with abnormal fat deposition in liver and skeletal muscle, which are important determinants of insulin resistance. Global MIF-gene deletion protected mice from olanzapine-induced insulin resistance, as did intracerebroventricular injection of neutralizing anti-MIF antibody, supporting the role of increased hypothalamic MIF expression in metabolic dysfunction. These findings uphold the potential pharmacogenomic value of MIF genotype determination and suggest that MIF may be a tractable target for reducing the metabolic side effects of atypical antipsychotic therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1172/JCI93090,"Adipose Tissue/*metabolism/pathology;Adolescent;Adult;Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Body Mass Index;Eating/drug effects;Female;HeLa Cells;Humans;Hypothalamus/*metabolism/pathology;*Insulin Resistance;Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/*metabolism;Lipids/blood;Lipolysis/drug effects;Liver/metabolism/pathology;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/*metabolism;Male;Mice;Middle Aged;Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/pathology;Olanzapine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Macrophages;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors",30295645,PMC6205380

Polymorphisms in the type-three metabotropic glutamate receptor gene (GRM3) have been associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a pharmacogenetic relationship exists between six polymorphisms of GRM3 and clinical improvement during olanzapine treatment in persons with schizophrenia. METHOD: Forty-two subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia started olanzapine and were titrated to a fixed dose of 7.5-20 mg/day for 6 weeks. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were completed at baseline and then weekly to assess psychopathology. RESULTS: The principle finding of this study is that GRM3 polymorphisms were collectively significant predictors of negative symptom improvement in persons with schizophrenia treated with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. After controlling for baseline SANS scores, the genotypes as a whole were significant predictors of negative symptom improvement, accounting for approximately 28% of the variance in scores (F = 16.30, df = 29, p < 0.001). The single nucleotide polymorphism SNP1 (rs274622), located in a potential promoter region, had the most significant influence on SANS scores, but the effects of this locus could not be fully separated from the other polymorphisms. The mean decrease in SANS scores was 21% vs. 51% for SNP1 T/T + T/C and SNP1C/C subjects, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that polymorphisms in the GRM3 gene may be useful as predictors of negative symptom improvement in persons with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.schres.2005.04.001,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*pharmacology;Benzodiazepines/pharmacology;Female;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Olanzapine;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenic Psychology;Treatment Outcome;Polymorphism, Genetic",15913960,

Because many antidepressants inhibit the transporter, it has been the focus of intense pharmacogenetic analysis. We sought to replicate our previous findings that SLC6A4 is associated with response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a large case-control study. METHODS: Genotypes at the SLC6A4 locus were obtained for 1,914 subjects in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study and then tested for association to treatment response of the SSRI citalopram. RESULTS: Nine tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms and two variants previously associated with antidepressant response, including a promoter repeat polymorphism, were genotyped. Single marker and haplotypic analyses failed to detect association with antidepressant response in the largest clinical sample studied to date. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between response to an SSRI and variation at the SLC6A4 locus in this large sample, carefully characterized for response to citalopram, strongly suggests that SSRI response in major depression is not determined by DNA variation at this locus.

METHODS: Resting state 64-channel EEG data were recorded from 44 patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) as part of a larger, multisite discovery study of biomarkers in antidepressant treatment response, conducted by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND). Clinical response was measured at 8-weeks post-treatment as change from baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of 50% or more. EEG measures were analyzed at (1) pre-treatment baseline (2) 2 weeks post-treatment and (3) as an ''early change"" variable defined as change in EEG from baseline to 2 weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, treatment responders showed elevated absolute alpha power in the left hemisphere while non-responders showed the opposite. Responders further exhibited a cortical asymmetry in the parietal region. Groups also differed in pre-treatment relative delta power with responders showing greater power in the right hemisphere over the left while non-responders showed the opposite. At 2 weeks post-treatment, responders exhibited greater absolute beta power in the left hemisphere relative to the right and the opposite was noted for non-responders. A reverse pattern was noted for absolute and relative delta power at 2 weeks post-treatment. Responders exhibited early reductions in relative alpha power and early increments in relative theta power. Non-responders showed a significant early increase in prefrontal theta cordance.

After exposure of the rat serotonergic cell line RN46A to VPA, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed widespread changes in gene expression. Analysis by four bioinformatic pipelines revealed as many as 230 genes were significantly upregulated and 72 genes were significantly downregulated. A subset of 23 differentially expressed genes was selected for validation using the nCounter® platform, and of these we obtained robust validation for ADAM23, LSP1, MAOB, MMP13, PAK3, SERPINB2, SNAP91, WNT6, and ZCCHC12. We investigated the effect of lithium on this subset and found four genes, CDKN1C, LSP1, SERPINB2, and WNT6 co-regulated by lithium and VPA. We also explored the effects of other HDAC inhibitors and the VPA analogue valpromide on the subset of 23 selected genes. Expression of eight of these genes, CDKN1C, MAOB, MMP13, NGFR, SHANK3, VGF, WNT6 and ZCCHC12, was modified by HDAC inhibition, whereas others did not appear to respond to several HDAC inhibitors tested. These results suggest VPA may regulate genes through both HDAC-dependent and independent mechanisms. Understanding the broader gene regulatory effects of VPA in this serotonergic cell model should provide insights into how this drug works and whether other HDAC inhibitor compounds may have similar gene regulatory effects, as well as highlighting molecular processes that may underlie regulation of mood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1038/s41397-021-00215-x,"Animals;Antimanic Agents/*pharmacology;Cell Line;Computational Biology;Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/*genetics;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Histone Deacetylases/metabolism;Lithium/pharmacology;RNA-Seq;Rats;Serotonin/*metabolism;Transcription, Genetic/*genetics;Transcriptional Activation;Valproic Acid/*pharmacology;Genes, Regulator;Valproic Acid",33649518,

The mechanism of action in stabilizing mood has not been fully elucidated, but alterations in N-Acetylaspartate (NAA), Myo-Inositol (mI) and Choline (Cho) have been implicated. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is the gold standard technique for measuring brain NAA, Cho and mI in vivo. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of lithium use in BD type I and brain levels of NAA, mI and Cho in the (anterior cingulate cortex) ACC. METHODS: 129 BD type I subjects and 79 healthy controls (HC) were submitted to a 3-Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging scan ((1)H-MRS) using a PRESS ACC single voxel (8cm(3)) sequence. RESULTS: BD patients exhibited higher NAA and Cho levels compared to HC. Lithium prescription was associated with lower mI (combination + monotherapy) and higher NAA levels (monotherapy). CONCLUSION: The results observed add to the knowledge about the mechanisms of action of mood stabilizers on brain metabolites during euthymia. Additionally, the observed decrease in mI levels associated with lithium monotherapy is an in vivo finding that supports the inositol-depletion hypothesis of lithium pharmacodynamics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.jad.2018.08.039,Adult;Antimanic Agents/*pharmacology;Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/analysis;Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy;Brain/enzymology;Brain Chemistry;Choline/analysis;Cyclothymic Disorder/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy;Female;Gyrus Cinguli/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/metabolism;Humans;Inositol/analysis;Lithium Compounds/*pharmacology;Male;Middle Aged;Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods;Treatment Outcome;Bipolar Disorder;Lithium,30130684,

Here, we investigated a possible pharmacogenetic effect of antipsychotic treatment on QTc length in interaction with two NOS1AP variants (rs12143842 and rs10494366) whose minor alleles are associated with increased QTc interval length. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electrocardiographic (ECG) and genotype data of 239 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. We converted antipsychotics dosage to chlorpromazine equivalents and defined daily doses. We analysed the effects of the minor (i. e. rs12143842-CT/TT and rs10494366-GT/GG) and major (i. e. rs12143842-CC and rs10494366-TT) allele genotypes to QTc interval for female and male participants separately. RESULTS: As expected, rs12143842 and rs10494366 exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium. Both polymorphisms had no direct effect on antipsychotic use or QTc interval. However, there was a continuous increase in QTc interval with increasing antipsychotic dosage in males.

There was no significant interaction between antipsychotic dosage and QTc interval for either genotype in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a significant interaction was found between both NOS1AP variants, rs12143842 and rs10494366, and antipsychotic treatment on the QTc interval in a sex-dependent manner.

CONCLUSIONS: The observed DMXB-A-related changes are consistent with improved default network function in schizophrenia. Pharmacogenetic analysis indicates mediation of the effect through the α7-nicotinic receptor. These results further implicate nicotinic cholinergic dysfunction in the disease and suggest that default network activity may be a useful indicator of biological effects of novel therapeutic agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.07.004,"Adult;Benzylidene Compounds/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Brain/drug effects;Brain Mapping/methods;Cognition Disorders/blood/complications/*drug therapy/genetics;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Eye Movements/drug effects;Female;Genotype;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Neural Pathways/*drug effects;Nicotinic Agonists/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Pyridines/blood/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Receptors, Nicotinic/*genetics;Schizophrenia/blood/complications/*drug therapy/genetics;alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor;Nicotinic Agonists;Niacin;Schizophrenia",20728875,PMC3005969

Several genetic variants in the cytokine system have been associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a pharmacogenetic relationship exists between a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN) and clinical improvement during antipsychotic treatment in patients with a first non-affective psychotic episode. One hundred and fifty-four subjects presenting with a first non-affective psychotic episode were randomly assigned to treatment with haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine and rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) both at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. A control sample of 336 blood bank donors was also included. No differences in genotype or allele distributions were found between patients and controls. However, after controlling for baseline SANS scores, the genotype in the VNTR polymorphism in the IL-1RN gene significantly predicted negative symptom improvement, accounting for approximately 7% of the variance (F = 5.23, df = 2, P = 0.006). The mean decrease in SANS scores was 58% for the IL-1RN* 2/2, 44% for the IL-1RN* 1/2, and 14% for the IL-1RN* 1/1 subjects, respectively. These results suggest that the VNTR polymorphism in the IL-1RN gene may be a useful predictor of negative symptom improvement in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotic drugs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ajmg.b.30405,"Adult;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Benzodiazepines/therapeutic use;Female;Genotype;Haloperidol/therapeutic use;Humans;Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/*genetics;Male;Olanzapine;*Polymorphism, Genetic;Risperidone/therapeutic use;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Spain;Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics;Treatment Outcome;Whites/genetics",16921503,

During the last 4 weeks of pregnancy the mean sertraline C/D ratio (95% CI), 0.25 (0.19, 0.3) ng/mL/dose (mg/day), was smaller than the mean ratio at ≥ 8 weeks after delivery, 0.32 (0.27, 0.37) ng/mL/dose (mg/day), a 22% difference. Mean sertraline/desmethylsertraline ratios were highest after birth, which confirmed increased sertraline elimination during pregnancy. Sertraline C/D ratios in participants with functional CYP2C19 activity did not change significantly during pregnancy, while ratios in participants with poor or intermediate CYP2C19 activity decreased by 51%.

We undertook a search for sequence variations in the coding region of beta 1 subunit gene by designing intron-based primers to amplify its 9 exons. Using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, we found an exon 9 variant present in 3 of 86 unrelated schizophrenic cases derived from families having at least 2 first-degree relatives with schizophrenia. Direct sequencing of the SSCP variant revealed a C-->G nucleotide transversion at codon 396 predicting a histidine to glutamine substitution in the beta 1 peptide. The predicted amino acid substitution occurs at a highly conserved site, 9 residues from a cAMP-dependent serine phosphorylation consensus sequence. All known GABAA beta 1 subunit genes including human, bovine, and rat, code for histidine at position 396. Although the variant cosegregated with disease in a family with 2 affected sibs, it was only transmitted to 2 of 3 affected sibs in a multiplex family. The variant was not found in an additional sample comprising 155 unrelated schizophrenics and the sequence variant was present at a low frequency (approximately 1.1%) in control groups. Although these results indicate that the sequence variant is likely to be a natural polymorphism, it is possible that the variant may be a predisposing allele in rare instances. It is also possible that the variant may change the function or regulation of the GABAA receptor complex and it may be of pharmacogenetic relevance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1002/ajmg.1320540105,"Adolescent;Aged;Alleles;Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;DNA Mutational Analysis/methods;DNA Primers;Exons;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleic Acid Conformation;Pedigree;*Point Mutation;Polymerase Chain Reaction;*Polymorphism, Genetic;Pregnancy;Receptors, GABA-A/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*genetics;Mutation;Schizophrenia",8178835,

We hypothesized that co-expression pathways of SCZ risk genes are associated with system-level brain function and clinical phenotypes of SCZ. We examined genetic variants related to the dopamine D2 receptor gene DRD2 co-expression pathway and associated them with working memory (WM) behavior, the related brain activity and treatment response. Using two independent post-mortem prefrontal messenger RNA (mRNA) data sets (total N=249), we identified a DRD2 co-expression pathway enriched for SCZ risk genes. Next, we identified non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with co-expression of this pathway. These SNPs were associated with regulatory genetic loci in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P<0.05). We summarized their compound effect on co-expression into a Polygenic Co-expression Index (PCI), which predicted DRD2 pathway co-expression in both mRNA data sets (all P<0.05). We associated the PCI with brain activity during WM performance in two independent samples of healthy individuals (total N=368) and 29 patients with SCZ who performed the n-back task. Greater predicted DRD2 pathway prefrontal co-expression was associated with greater prefrontal activity and longer WM reaction times (all corrected P<0.05), thus indicating inefficient WM processing. Blind prediction of treatment response to antipsychotics in two independent samples of patients with SCZ suggested better clinical course of patientswith greater PCI (total N=87; P<0.05). The findings on this DRD2 co-expression pathway are a proof of concept that gene co-expression can parse SCZ risk genes into biological pathways associated with intermediate phenotypes as well as with clinically meaningful information.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/tp.2016.253,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Autopsy;Brain/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/physiopathology;Child;Child, Preschool;Female;Functional Neuroimaging;Gene Regulatory Networks;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;*Memory, Short-Term;Middle Aged;Multifactorial Inheritance;N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/genetics;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/physiopathology;RNA, Messenger/*metabolism;Receptors, Dopamine D2/*genetics;Repressor Proteins/genetics;Schizophrenia/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology;Transcriptome;Young Adult;Schizophrenia;Phenotype",28094815,PMC5545721

However, treatment response during an initial therapeutic trial is often poor and is difficult to predict. Heterogeneity of response to SSRIs in depressed patients is partly driven by co-occurring somatic disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and obesity. CAD and obesity may also be associated with metabolic side effects of SSRIs. In this study, we assessed the association of CAD and obesity with treatment response to SSRIs in patients with MDD using a polygenic score (PGS) approach. Additionally, we performed cross-trait meta-analyses to pinpoint genetic variants underpinnings the relationship of CAD and obesity with SSRIs treatment response. First, PGSs were calculated at different p value thresholds (P(T)) for obesity and CAD. Next, binary logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association of the PGSs to SSRIs treatment response in a discovery sample (ISPC, N = 865), and in a replication cohort (STAR*D, N = 1,878). Finally, a cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis was performed by combining summary statistics. We show that the PGSs for CAD and obesity were inversely associated with SSRIs treatment response. At the most significant thresholds, the PGS for CAD and body mass index accounted 1.3%, and 0.8% of the observed variability in treatment response to SSRIs, respectively. In the cross-trait meta-analyses, we identified (1) 14 genetic loci (including NEGR1, CADM2, PMAIP1, PARK2) that are associated with both obesity and SSRIs treatment response; (2) five genetic loci (LINC01412, PHACTR1, CDKN2B, ATXN2, KCNE2) with effects on CAD and SSRIs treatment response. Our findings implicate that the genetic variants of CAD and obesity are linked to SSRIs treatment response in MDD. A better SSRIs treatment response might be achieved through a stratified allocation of treatment for MDD patients with a genetic risk for obesity or CAD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00702-018-01966-x,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Body Mass Index;Comorbidity;Coronary Artery Disease/epidemiology/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/epidemiology;Female;Genetic Loci;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Obesity/epidemiology/*genetics;*Outcome Assessment, Health Care;*Pharmacogenomic Variants;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Young Adult;Obesity",30610379,

Tryptophan hydroxylase (tryptophan 5-monooxygenase; TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, and sequence variation in intron 6 of the TPH1 gene has been associated with schizophrenia. The minor allele (A) of this polymorphism (A218C) is also more frequent in patients who have attempted suicide and individuals who died by suicide, than in healthy control individuals. In an attempt to replicate previous findings, five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 837 Scandinavian schizophrenia patients and 1,473 controls. Three SNPs spanning intron 6 and 7, including the A218C and A779C polymorphisms, were associated with schizophrenia susceptibility (P = 0.019). However there were no differences in allele frequencies of these loci between affected individuals having attempted suicide at least once and patients with no history of suicide attempts (P = 0.84). A systematic literature review and meta-analysis support the A218C polymorphism as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.29). Association studies on suicide attempts are however conflicting (heterogeneity index I(2) = 0.54) and do not support the A218C/A779C polymorphisms being a susceptibility locus for suicidal behavior among individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (OR = 0.96 [0.80-1.16]). We conclude that the TPH1 A218/A779 locus increases the susceptibility of schizophrenia in Caucasian and Asian populations. In addition, the data at hand suggest that the locus contributes to the liability of psychiatric disorders characterized by elevated suicidal rates, rather than affecting suicidal behavior of individuals suffering from a psychiatric disorder.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.1002/ajmg.b.30991,"Adult;Alleles;Case-Control Studies;Female;*Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Schizophrenia/*genetics;Serotonin/pharmacology;*Suicide;Suicide, Attempted;Tryptophan Hydroxylase/*genetics;Suicide;Tryptophan;Schizophrenia",19526457,

Multiple studies have analyzed the functional BDNF Val66Met variant in relation to antipsychotic response in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients, yielding mixed results. A meta-analysis was thus performed to examine the relationship between this variant and symptom improvement during antipsychotic treatment. Searches using PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo until October 2017 yielded 11 studies that met inclusion criteria (total n = 3774). These studies investigated the BDNF Val66Met variant and antipsychotic response in patients with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. Responders to antipsychotics were defined using the original criteria applied in each study. Effect sizes were computed using odds ratios, which were pooled according to the Mantel-Haenszel method. The BDNF Val66Met variant was not associated with the total number of responders and non-responders (p > 0.05) under dominant, recessive, or allelic models. Secondary analyses stratifying for individuals of each ethnicity and drug type also revealed no significant associations. Our findings suggest that the BDNF Val66Met variant is not associated with response to antipsychotics in individuals with SCZ. However, considering the current sample size, small effects cannot be ruled out. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that Val66Met forms haplotypes with other BDNF variants. Future studies should examine the Val66Met variant in conjunction with these other variants in relation to antipsychotic response. Moreover, since illness duration appears to influence BDNF levels in SCZ patients, future studies should aim to control for this potential confounding factor in response analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: meta-analysis",10.1038/s41397-018-0041-5,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics;Female;Genotype;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy/*genetics;Young Adult;Schizophrenia;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Polymorphism, Genetic;Psychotic Disorders",30181602,

It is one of the common cause of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR). Clinical symptoms of LTG-induced CADR range from maculopapular exanthema (MPE) to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR). This study aimed to determine the association of the LTG-induced CADR with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in Thai patients. Methods: Fifteen patients with LTG-induced CADR [10 MPE; 4 Stevens-Johnson syndrome; and 1 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms] and 50 LTG-tolerant controls were included in the study. HLA-A and HLA-B genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotides probes. Results: The proportion of HLA-A(∗)02:07 and HLA-B(∗)15:02 allele carriers were significantly higher in the LTG-induced CADR group than in the tolerant controls [odds ratio (OR): 7.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-38.25; P = 0.013, and OR: 4.89; 95% CI: 1.28-18.67; P = 0.014]. In addition, subjects with HLA-A(∗)33:03, HLA-B(∗)15:02, and HLA-B(∗)44:03 were significantly higher in the LTG-induced MPE group than in the tolerant controls (OR: 8.27; 95% CI: 1.83-37.41; P = 0.005, OR: 7.33; 95% CI: 1.63-33.02; P = 0.005; and OR: 10.29; 95% CI: 1.45-72.81; P = 0.029). In contrast to the LTG-induced MPE group, there were no significant differences between HLA alleles and LTG-induced SCAR group. Conclusion:HLA-A(∗)02:07 and HLA-B(∗)15:02 were associated with LTG-induced CADR in Thai patients. We also identified an association between HLA-A(∗)33:03, HLA-B(∗)15:02, and HLA-B(∗)44:03 and LTG-induced MPE in this population. These results suggest that these alleles could be useful screening markers for preventing CADR before LTG treatment in Thai patients, but further replication studies with larger sample sizes are needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fphar.2017.00879,HLA-G Antigens;Alleles;HLA-C Antigens;HLA-D Antigens;HLA-A Antigens;HLA-B Antigens,29238301,PMC5712579

Recently, the Psychosis Metabolic Risk Calculator (PsyMetRiC) was developed and externally validated in the UK, predicting up-to six-year risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) from routinely collected data. The full-model includes age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, smoking status, prescription of metabolically-active antipsychotic medication, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride concentrations; the partial-model excludes biochemical predictors. METHODS: To move toward a future internationally-useful tool, we externally validated PsyMetRiC in two independent European samples. We used data from the PsyMetab (Lausanne, Switzerland) and PAFIP (Cantabria, Spain) cohorts, including participants aged 16-35y without MetS at baseline who had 1-6y follow-up. Predictive performance was assessed primarily via discrimination (C-statistic), calibration (calibration plots), and decision curve analysis. Site-specific recalibration was considered. FINDINGS: We included 1024 participants (PsyMetab n=558, male=62%, outcome prevalence=19%, mean follow-up=2.48y; PAFIP n=466, male=65%, outcome prevalence=14%, mean follow-up=2.59y). Discrimination was better in the full- compared with partial-model (PsyMetab=full-model C=0.73, 95% C.I., 0.68-0.79, partial-model C=0.68, 95% C.I., 0.62-0.74; PAFIP=full-model C=0.72, 95% C.I., 0.66-0.78; partial-model C=0.66, 95% C.I., 0.60-0.71). As expected, calibration plots revealed varying degrees of miscalibration, which recovered following site-specific recalibration. PsyMetRiC showed net benefit in both new cohorts, more so after recalibration. INTERPRETATION: The study provides evidence of PsyMetRiC's generalizability in Western Europe, although further local and international validation studies are required. In future, PsyMetRiC could help clinicians internationally to identify young people with psychosis who are at higher cardiometabolic risk, so interventions can be directed effectively to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether risk polymorphisms in 12 candidate genes are associated with reduction in body mass index (BMI) of patients following switching of antipsychotics to aripiprazole or ziprasidone. METHODS: We recruited 115 schizophrenia patients with metabolic abnormalities and who have been on at least 1 year treatment with other antipsychotics; they were then switched to either aripiprazole or ziprasidone. They were genotyped, and their BMI monitored for 6 months. RESULTS: Significant associations with reduction in BMI at 6 months following switching were found in two of these genes: with rs1800544 of the ADRA2A gene (CC + CG [-0.32 ± 1.41 kg/m²] vs GG [-1.04 ± 1.63 kg/m²], p = 0.013) and with rs1801131 of the MTHFR gene (AA [-0.36 ± 1.53] vs AC + CC [-1.07 ± 1.53], p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: The study data indicated that carriage of the ADRA2A rs1800544 GG genotype and the MTHFR rs1801131 C allele are associated with BMI reduction in this population following switching of antipsychotics to aripiprazole and ziprasidone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1002/hup.2366,"Adult;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use;Aripiprazole;Body Mass Index;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Genotype;Humans;Male;Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics;Middle Aged;Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Polymorphism, Genetic;Quinolones/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2/*genetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy;Thiazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;Weight Gain/drug effects;Weight Loss/*genetics;Weight Loss;Antipsychotic Agents",24424705,

P-gp protects the brain by selectively extruding its substrates, including certain antidepressive drugs, thereby limiting their uptake into the brain. Uhr et al. [2008] first showed that ABCB1 variants predicted the remission to antidepressants with P-gp substrate properties in patients suffering from major depression (MD). Other studies investigating the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on antidepressant treatment response produced inconclusive results. In this meta-analysis, we systematically summarized 16 pharmacogenetic studies focused on the association of ABCB1 variants and antidepressant treatment outcome in patients with MD (overall n = 2695). We investigated the association of treatment outcome and six ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs2032583, rs2235015, rs2235040, rs1045642, rs2032582, rs1128503. We stratified for admission status, ethnicity, and prescription of concomitant medication. SNP rs2032583 showed a nominally significant association across all studies (P = 0.035, SNP was studied in a total of 2,037 patients) and a significant Bonferroni-corrected association among inpatients (P = 1.5 × 10(-05) , n = 485). Also SNP rs2235015 was significantly associated with antidepressant treatment outcome withstanding Bonferroni correction (P = 3.0 × 10(-04) ) among inpatients in a smaller subsample (n = 195). There were no significant associations of the other SNPs tested with antidepressant treatment outcome.

We have audited data from an olanzapine TDM service, 1999-2009. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the contribution of dose, age, sex, body weight, and smoking status to the plasma olanzapine concentration. There were 5856 samples from 3207 patients. The prescribed olanzapine dosage was 2.5 to 95 mg/d. No olanzapine was detected in 6% of samples. For olanzapine dosages of 2.5 to 20 mg/d, only 35% of results were within a suggested target range of 20 to 39 ng/mL. At doses above 20 mg/d, 30% to 59% of results were 60 ng/mL or greater depending on dose band. In patients aged 17 years or younger (92 samples), median plasma olanzapine was higher than that in adult patients at almost all olanzapine doses. Multiple linear regression analysis of results from 627 adults from whom complete data were available showed that dose, smoking status, sex, age, and body weight together explained 24% the variance in plasma olanzapine. Degree of adherence, timing of sample postdose, drug-drug interactions, and pharmacogenetic factors also may have contributed to the observed variance. However, it is clear that female nonsmokers had higher plasma olanzapine concentrations for a given dose than male smokers. Olanzapine TDM is useful in assessing adherence and may have a role in limiting olanzapine dosage to minimize the risk of long-term toxicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1097/JCP.0b013e318221b408,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Benzodiazepines/*administration & dosage/*blood;Child;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Monitoring/*methods;*Drug Prescriptions;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Olanzapine;Patient Compliance;Young Adult;Drug Monitoring",21694620,

Yet, the disease is inadequately understood, diagnosed and treated. Moreover, with the recent drastic rise in the pace of life, stress has materialized as one of the most potent environmental factors for depression. In this scenario, it is important to understand the modern pathogenetic hypotheses and mechanisms, and possibly try to shift from the traditional approaches in depression therapy. These include the elaboration of pathophysiological changes in heterogeneous systems such as genetic, epigenetic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, gammaaminobutyric acid, glutamatergic and endocannabinoid systems, neurotrophic factors, HPA axis, immune system as well as cellular stress mechanisms. These components interact with each other in a complex matrix and further elucidation of their mechanism and cascade pathways are needed. This might aid in the identification of MDD subtypes as well as the development of sophisticated biomarkers. Further, characterization might also aid in developing multitargeted therapies that hold much promise as compared to the conventional monoamine based treatment. New candidate pharmacons, refined psychotherapeutic modalities, advanced neuro-surgical and imaging techniques as well as the implementation of pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic prescribing guidelines constitute the emerging expanses of MDD treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.2174/1570159X17666191001142934,"Animals;Brain/*physiopathology;Depressive Disorder, Major/complications/genetics/*physiopathology/therapy;Epigenesis, Genetic;Humans;Stress, Physiological;Stress, Psychological/complications/genetics/*physiopathology;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major",31573890,PMC7327947

The objective of the study was to review the cost-effectiveness of interventions to enhance medication adherence in patients with mental health problems. METHODS: The update of a previous systematic review was performed. Databases were searched in June 2019: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, CRD, WOS. Cost-effectiveness studies comparing an intervention to improve the medication adherence with other interventions/usual care in adults with mental health problems were included. Data were extracted, methodological quality of the studies was assessed and a narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. The interventions that showed medication adherence increase were: a financial incentive when depot injection was taken by patients with psychotic disorders, a value-based benefit design policy including copayment and counselling in a company setting, and a medication treatment decision supported by a pharmacogenetic test. The other studies (coaching by pharmacists; a psychological and educational intervention at health care centres) did not find differences between groups. No study found cost differences between alternatives. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to improve medication adherence in adults with mental health problems could be cost-effective, especially those based on financial incentives, although more research is needed. KEYPOINTS There are several types of interventions designed to enhance medication adherence in patients with mental health problems. Few of them have demonstrated cost-effectiveness. Two studies found that a financial incentive per depot injection in patients with psychotic disorders improved the medication adherence. Two other studies found improvement in adherence due to two specific interventions: a value-based benefit design policy in a company setting and a pharmacogenetic test supporting the medication treatment decision. No study found differences in costs between the intervention and the comparator.

Thousands of subjects of Caucasian ancestry have been included in previous GWAS investigating antidepressant response. GWAS focused on this phenotype are lacking in Asian populations. METHODS: A sample of 109 major depressive disorder (MDD) patients of Korean origin in antidepressant treatment was collected. Phenotypes were response and remission according to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Genome-wide genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human Omni2.5-8 platform. The same phenotypes were used in the STAR*D level 1 (n = 1677) for independent replication. In order to corroborate findings and increase the comparability between the two datasets, three levels of analysis (SNPs, genes and pathways) were carried out. Bonferroni correction, permutations, and replication across samples were used to reduce the risk of false positives. RESULTS: Among the genes replicated across the two samples (permutated p < 0.05 in both of them), CTNNA3 appeared promising. The inorganic cation transmembrane transporter activity pathway (GO:0022890) was associated with antidepressant response in both samples (p = 2.9e-5 and p = 0.001 in the Korean and STAR*D samples, respectively) and this pathway included CACNA1A, CACNA1C, and CACNB2 genes.

Next, we performed a replication analysis in 36 treatment-resistant TD and 138 non-TD subjects. An association of an SNP in the DPP6 (dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein-6) gene, rs6977820, the most promising association identified by the screen, was significant in the replication sample (allelic P=0.008 in the replication sample, allelic P=4.6 × 10(-6), odds ratio 2.32 in the combined sample). The SNP is located in intron-1 of the DPP6 gene and the risk allele was associated with decreased DPP6 gene expression in the human postmortem prefrontal cortex.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-eight Japanese outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition, were included (mean±SD age, 47.3±12.4 years; 90 men (60.8%)). Attitudes toward antipsychotic treatment and insight into illness were assessed with the Drug Attitude Inventory-10 (DAI-10) and the VAGUS, respectively. In addition, a multiple-choice questionnaire that was designed to examine patients' knowledge about therapeutic effects, types, and implicated neurotransmitters of antipsychotic drugs they were receiving was utilized. RESULTS: The mean±SD of DAI-10 score was 4.7±4.2. The multiple regression analysis found that lower Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores, higher VAGUS scores, and longer illness duration were significantly associated with higher DAI-10 scores (β=-0.226, P=0.009; β=0.250, P=0.008; β=0.203, P=0.034, respectively).

CONCLUSION: Better insight into illness and treatment, lower illness severity, longer illness duration, and possibly greater knowledge about the therapeutic effects of medications may lead to better attitudes towards pharmacotherapy among patients with schizophrenia, which has an important implication for this typically chronic mental condition requiring long-term antipsychotic treatment to sustain stability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.2147/NDT.S240377,Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section;Schizophrenia,32256074,PMC7101063

Its metabolism has recently been reported to be mediated through the CYP enzymes 1A2 and 2D6. In our current study, we tested whether genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 are associated with the treatment efficacy and side effects of paroxetine. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of 241 MDD patients who had taken paroxetine continually for 8 weeks were recruited, and their steady state paroxetine concentrations were measured at weeks 2, 4 and 8. The genotypes of these patients were then assessed for the presence of nine SNPs, which were selected from either the HapMap Chinese ethnic group, the literature report or through their functional role in the CYP1A2 gene. RESULTS: The allele types for SNPs rs4646425 (permutation p = 0.03), rs2472304 (permutation p = 0.01) and rs2470890 (permutation p = 0.004) demonstrated significant associations with paroxetine treatment remission at week 8.

Moreover, this disease burden is predicted to rise in the next 20 years. Antidepressant medications are vital in the therapy of major depression. However, approximately 30-60% of patients treated with current antidepressant drugs fail to attain remission of depressive symptoms leading to drug resistance. Such patients account for a disproportionately great burden of disease, as supported by cost, augmented disability, and suicidal incidents. Antidepressants resistance remains to challenge mental health care professionals, and more relevant research relating newer medications is necessitated to enhance the quality of life of patients with depression. Enhancement in response rates continues the major challenge in antidepressant research, thus a wealth of potentials still exists concerning the antidepressant resistance for the management of major depression. However, the mechanisms causing resistance to antidepressant treatment remain unknown. Hence, clinical and basic research in understanding the fundamental mechanism of antidepressant resistance should remain a key priority. One potential source accounting for these differences in treatment outcome is genetic variations. The pharmacological mechanisms behind antidepressant response are only partly known but genetic factors play a significant role. Future research of risk factors should assist to advance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in mood disorders and contribute to progress their therapeutic management. Thus, psychiatrists could rely on more effective approaches to treat depressive episodes, reducing the incidence of further drug resistance. This review critically summarises the author's view on many aspects of treatment resistance, specific genetic biomarkers, potential strategies and clinical relevance from both clinical and preclinical studies in drug resistance to antidepressant therapies.

Subjects were drawn from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR(*)D) study, a multicenter, prospective, effectiveness trial in major depressive disorder (MDD). Outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD were initially treated with citalopram for up to 14 weeks; those who did not remit with citalopram were sequentially randomized to a series of next-step treatments, each for up to 12 weeks. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four genes were examined for association with remission, defined as a clinician-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C(16)) score < or =5. Of 1554 participants for whom DNA was available, 565 (36%) reached remission with citalopram treatment. No association with any of the four genes was identified. However, among the 751 who entered next-step treatment, variants in KCNK2 were associated with treatment response (Bonferroni-corrected, gene-based empirical p<0.001). In follow-up analyses, KCNK2 was also associated with effects of similar magnitude for third-step treatment among those with unsatisfactory benefit to both citalopram and one next-step pharmacotherapy (n=225). These findings indicate that genetic variation in KCNK2 may identify individuals at risk for treatment resistance.

Some proportion of such patients do not show adequate response to treatment regimen containing phenazepam, whereas many of them experience type A adverse drug reactions. Previous studies showed that CYP2D6 IS involved in the biotransformation of phenazepam, the activity of which is highly dependent on the polymorphism of the gene encoding it. Objective. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of 1846G>A polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the concentration/dose indicator of phenazepam, using findings on enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 (as evaluated by the 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and on CYP2D6 expression level obtained by measuring the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration levels in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 191 patients with recurrent depressive disorder (age -40.0 ± 16.3 years). Treatment regimen included phenazepam in an average daily dose of 6.0 ± 2.3 mg per day. Treatment efficacy was assessed using the validated psychometric scales. Therapy safety was assessed using the UKU Side-Effect Rating Scale. For genotyping and estimation of the microRNA (miRNA) plasma levels we performed the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR Real-time). The activity of CYP2D6 was evaluated using the HPLC-MS/MS method by the content of the endogenous substrate of given isoenzyme and its metabolite in urine (6M-THBC/pinoline). Therapeutic drug monitoring has been performed using HPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Our findings didn't reveal the statistically significant results in terms of the treatment efficacy evaluation (HAMA scores at the end of the treatment course): (GG) 6.0 [4.0; 8.0] and (GA) 6.0 [5.0; 7.8], p > 0.999; the statistical significance in the safety profile was not obtained (the UKU scores): (GG) 3.0 [2.0; 4.0] and (GA) 3.0 [3.0; 3.0], p > 0.999. We didn't reveal a statistical significance for concentration/dose indicator of phenazepam in patients with different genotypes: (GG) 0.812 [0.558; 1.348] and (GA) 0.931 [0.630; 1.271], p = 0.645). Analysis of the results of the pharmacotranscriptomic part of the study didn't show the statistically significant difference in the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma levels in patients with different genotypes: (GG) 22.5 [16.9; 29.8], (GA) 22.7 [15.7; 31.5], p = 0.695. At the same time, correlation analysis didn't reveal a statistically significant relationship between the phenazepam efficacy profile evaluated by changes in HAMA scale scores and the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration: rs = -0.01, p = 0.866. Also, we didn't reveal the correlation between the miRNA concentration and safety profile: rs = 0.07, p = 0.348. Also we did not reveal the relationship between the CYP2D6 enzymatic activity (as evaluated by 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration: rs = -0.14, p = 0.056. At the same time, correlation analysis did not reveal a statistically significant relationship between the phenazepam concentration and the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration: rs = -0.05, p = 0.468. CONCLUSION: The effect of genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the efficacy and safety profiles of phenazepam was not demonstrated in a group of 191 patients with recurrent depressive disorder. At the same time, hsa-miR-370-3p does not remain a promising biomarker for assessing the level of CYP2D6 expression, because it does not correlate with encoded isoenzyme activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",,"Benzodiazepines/*pharmacokinetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*blood/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Humans;MicroRNAs/*genetics;Tandem Mass Spectrometry;Depressive Disorder;Recurrence;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6",34887601,PMC8601761
Activation of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Factors by Fenofibrate and Gemfibrozil Stimulates Myelination in Zebrafish.,2016,,,Frontiers in pharmacology,1663-9812 (Print),7,,206,Ashikawa Y and Nishimura Y and Okabe S and Sasagawa S and Murakami S and Yuge M and Kawaguchi K and Kawase R and Tanaka T,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27462272/,eng,,,"Oligodendrocytes are major myelin-producing cells and play essential roles in the function of a healthy nervous system. However, they are also one of the most vulnerable neural cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin abnormalities in the CNS are found in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, and schizophrenia. There is an urgent need to identify small molecular weight compounds that can stimulate myelination. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis to identify pharmacodynamic effects common to miconazole and clobetasol, which have been shown to stimulate myelination by mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Of the genes differentially expressed in both miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mouse OPCs compared with untreated cells, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both drug treatments. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these DEGs are significantly associated with the sterol biosynthetic pathway, and further bioinformatics analysis suggested that sterol regulatory element binding factors (SREBFs) might be key upstream regulators of the DEGs. In silico screening of a public database for chemicals associated with SREBF activation identified fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist, as a drug that increases the expression of known SREBF targets, raising the possibility that fenofibrate may also stimulate myelination. To test this, we performed in vivo imaging of zebrafish expressing a fluorescent reporter protein under the control of the myelin basic protein (mbp) promoter. Treatment of zebrafish with fenofibrate significantly increased expression of the fluorescent reporter compared with untreated zebrafish. This increase was attenuated by co-treatment with fatostatin, a specific inhibitor of SREBFs, confirming that the fenofibrate effect was mediated via SREBFs. Furthermore, incubation of zebrafish with another PPARα agonist, gemfibrozil, also increased expression of the mbp promoter-driven fluorescent reporter in an SREBF-dependent manner. These results suggest that activation of SREBFs by small molecular weight compounds may be a feasible therapeutic approach to stimulate myelination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.3389/fphar.2016.00206,Fenofibrate,27462272,PMC4939524

One of the main enzymes to take into account in pharmacogenomics is catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), which catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to catechols and catecholamines, like the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Although, most of this enzyme is associated to intracellular vesicles, recently it has also been detected in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocytes and in serum circulating vesicles. COMT has implications in many neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, chronic fatigue, pain response, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorders. Remarkably, genetic variations of COMT affect its activity and are associated to various human disorders from psychiatric diseases to estrogen-induced cancers. Consequently, the establishment of new methods to evaluate COMT activity is an important aspect to investigate the biology of this drug-metabolizing enzyme. Herein, we have developed a sensitive and selective method to determine COMT activity. We first optimized the activity in rat liver incubated with two different substrates; norepinephrine and dopamine. The enzymatically formed products (normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine, respectively) were extracted by solid-phase extraction using weak cation exchange cartridges, chromatographically separated, and detected and quantified using a mass spectrometer. The range of quantitation for both products was from 0.005 to 25 μg/mL. This methodology offers acceptable recovery for both enzymatic products (≥75%) and good accuracy and precision (≤15%). The lower limit of quantifications were 0.01 and 0.005 μM for 3-methoxytyramine and normetanephrine, respectively. Importantly, this sensitive assay was able to detect the presence of COMT activity in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocytes supporting a potential role of these vesicles in catecholamines and catecholestrogens metabolisms. In addition, the presence of COMT activity in extracellular vesicles opens new possibilities to develop tools to evaluate personalized drug response in a low invasive manner.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.3389/fphar.2016.00501,Rats;Catechols;Methyltransferases,28066248,PMC5179529

These agents were generally non-selective, developed primarily to target D2 receptors. In the last 10 years the understanding of the clinical implication of D3 receptors has been progressing also due to the identification of D3 gene polymorphisms, the use of more selective PET ligands such as [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO and the learning regarding the clinical use of the D3-preferential D2/D3 agonists ropinirole and pramipexole. A new specific neuroplasticity role of D3 receptor regarding dendrite arborisation outgrowth in dopaminergic neurons was also proposed to support, at least in part, the slowing of disease observed in subjects with Parkinson׳s Disease treated with DA agonists. Similar mechanisms could be at the basis of the antidepressant-like effects observed with DA agonists when co-administered with standard of care. Severe adverse event occurring with the use of anti-parkinsonian DA agonists in predisposed subjects, i.e., impulse control disorders, are now suggested to be putatively related to overactive D3 receptors. Not surprisingly, blockade of D3 receptors was proposed as treatment for addictive disorders, a goal that could be potentially achieved by repositioning buspirone, an anxiolytic drug with D3-preferential antagonistic features, or with novel selective D3 antagonists or partial agonists currently in development for schizophrenia. At the moment ABT-925 is the only selective D3 antagonist tested in schizophrenic patients in Phase II, showing an intriguing cognitive enhancing effects supported by preclinical data.

Previous drug discovery efforts pinpointed aripiprazole as an effective suppressor of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) pathogenesis, as its administration resulted in a reduced abundance and aggregation of mutant Ataxin-3 (ATXN3) proteins. Dopamine partial agonism and functional selectivity have been proposed as the main pharmacological mechanism of action of aripiprazole in the treatment of psychosis; however, this mechanism remains to be determined in the context of MJD. Here, we focus on confirming the efficacy of aripiprazole to reduce motor dysfunction in vivo, using a Caenorhabditis elegans&nbsp;(C. elegans) model of MJD, and on unveiling the drug targets required for its positive action against mutant ATXN3 pathogenesis. We employed pharmacogenetics and pharmacological approaches to identify which dopamine and serotonin receptors are critical for aripiprazole-mediated improvements in motor function. We demonstrated that dopamine D(2)-like and serotonin 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors play important roles in this process. Our findings strengthen the relevance of dopaminergic and serotoninergic signaling modulation against mutant ATXN3-mediated pathogenesis. The identification of aripiprazole's cellular targets, relevant for MJD and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases, may pave the way for prospective drug discovery and development campaigns aiming to improve the features of this prototypical compound and reduce side effects not negligible in the case of aripiprazole.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.3390/biomedicines10020370,Dopamine,35203579,PMC8962381

High compliance to mask-wearing conferred a significantly better protection (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.82) than low compliance. N95 or equivalent masks were the most effective in providing protection against coronavirus infections (OR, 0.30; CI, 0.20-0.44) consistently across subgroup analyses of causative viruses and clinical settings. Evidence supporting the use of medical or surgical masks against influenza or coronavirus infections (SARS, MERS and COVID-19) was weak. Our study confirmed that the use of facemasks provides protection against respiratory viral infections in general; however, the effectiveness may vary according to the type of facemask used. Our findings encourage the use of N95 respirators or their equivalents (e.g., P2) for best personal protection in healthcare settings until more evidence on surgical and medical masks is accrued.

This is needed to better differentiate disease and medication effects in clinical samples, to learn about neurochemical systems relevant for identified disturbances, and to facilitate identification of oculomotor biomarkers of pharmacological effects. In this review, studies of pharmacologic treatment effects on eye movements in healthy individuals are summarized and the sensitivity of eye movements to a variety of pharmacological manipulations is established. Primary findings from these studies of healthy individuals involving mainly acute effects indicate that: (i) the most consistent finding across several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, first- and second- generation antipsychotics, anticholinergic agents, and anticonvulsant/mood stabilizing medications is a decrease in saccade and smooth pursuit velocity (or increase in saccades during pursuit); (ii) these oculomotor effects largely reflect the general sedating effects of these medications on central nervous system functioning and are often dose-dependent; (iii) in many cases changes in oculomotor functioning are more sensitive indicators of pharmacological effects than other measures; and (iv) other agents, including the antidepressant class of serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, direct serotonergic agonists, and stimulants including amphetamine and nicotine, do not appear to adversely impact oculomotor functions in healthy individuals and may well enhance aspects of saccade and pursuit performance. Pharmacological treatment effects on eye movements across several clinical disorders including schizophrenia, affective disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are also reviewed. While greater recognition and investigation into pharmacological treatment effects in these disorders is needed, both beneficial and adverse drug effects are identified. This raises the important caveat for oculomotor studies of neuropsychiatric disorders that performance differences from healthy individuals cannot be attributed to illness effects alone. In final sections of this review, studies are presented that illustrate the utility of eye movements for use as potential biomarkers in pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic studies. While more systematic studies are needed, we conclude that eye movement measurements hold significant promise as tools to investigate treatment effects on cognitive and sensorimotor processes in clinical populations and that their use may be helpful in speeding the drug development pathway for drugs targeting specific neural systems and in individualizing pharmacological treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1016/j.bandc.2008.08.026,Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Benzodiazepines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Eye Movements/*drug effects;Humans;Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology;Parkinson Disease/drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology;Psychotic Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology;Saccades/drug effects;Eye Movements,19028266,PMC3159189

Because a strong synonymous codon usage bias in the human DRD2 gene, suggesting selection on synonymous positions, was revealed by the relative independence of the G+C content of the third codon positions from the isochoric G+C frequencies, we chose to investigate functional effects of the six known naturally occurring synonymous changes (C132T, G423A, T765C, C939T, C957T, and G1101A) in the human DRD2. We report here that some synonymous mutations in the human DRD2 have functional effects and suggest a novel genetic mechanism. 957T, rather than being 'silent', altered the predicted mRNA folding, led to a decrease in mRNA stability and translation, and dramatically changed dopamine-induced up-regulation of DRD2 expression. 1101A did not show an effect by itself but annulled the above effects of 957T in the compound clone 957T/1101A, demonstrating that combinations of synonymous mutations can have functional consequences drastically different from those of each isolated mutation. C957T was found to be in linkage disequilibrium in a European-American population with the -141C Ins/Del and TaqI 'A' variants, which have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and alcoholism, respectively.

Modulation of DISC1 expression alters the expression of a circumscribed set of genes (DISC1 Regulome) that are also implicated in brain biology and disorder. Here we report targeted sequencing of 59 DISC1 Interactome genes and 154 Regulome genes in 654 psychiatric patients and 889 cognitively-phenotyped control subjects, on whom we previously reported evidence for trait association from complete sequencing of the DISC1 locus. Burden analyses of rare and singleton variants predicted to be damaging were performed for psychiatric disorders, cognitive variables and personality traits. The DISC1 Interactome and Regulome showed differential association across the phenotypes tested. After family-wise error correction across all traits (FWER(across)), an increased burden of singleton disruptive variants in the Regulome was associated with SCZ (FWER(across) P=0.0339). The burden of singleton disruptive variants in the DISC1 Interactome was associated with low cognitive ability at age 11 (FWER(across) P=0.0043).

We seek to improve our understanding of this effectiveness by posing hypotheses based on new experimental data as well as published data, testing these hypotheses in silico, and posing new hypotheses for validation in future studies. We initially hypothesized a gene-by-environment interaction where lithium, acting as an environmental influence, impacts signal transduction pathways leading to differential expression of genes important in the etiology of BD mania. RESULTS: Using microarray and rt-QPCR assays, we identified candidate genes that are differentially expressed with lithium treatment. We used a systems biology approach to identify interactions among these candidate genes and develop a network of genes that interact with the differentially expressed candidates. Notably, we also identified cocaine as having a potential influence on the network, consistent with the observed high rate of comorbidity for BD and cocaine abuse. The resulting network represents a novel hypothesis on how multiple genetic influences on bipolar disorder are impacted by both lithium treatment and cocaine use. Testing this network for association with BD and related phenotypes, we find that it is significantly over-represented for genes that participate in signal transduction, consistent with our hypothesized-gene-by environment interaction. In addition, it models related pharmacogenomic, psychiatric, and chemical dependence phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We offer a network model of gene-by-environment interaction associated with lithium's effectiveness in treating BD mania, as well as the observed high rate of comorbidity of BD and cocaine abuse. We identified drug targets within this network that represent immediate candidates for therapeutic drug testing. Posing novel hypotheses for validation in future work, we prioritized SNPs near genes in the network based on functional annotation. We also developed a ""concept signature"" for the genes in the network and identified additional candidate genes that may influence the system because they are significantly associated with the signature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1186/1752-0509-4-158,"Adult;Bipolar Disorder/complications/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology;Brain/drug effects/metabolism;Cell Line;Cocaine-Related Disorders/complications/*genetics;Female;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Regulatory Networks/*drug effects;Humans;Lithium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;*Models, Genetic;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/drug effects/genetics;Reproducibility of Results;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics;Systems Biology;Treatment Outcome;Bipolar Disorder;Cocaine-Related Disorders;Cocaine",21092101,PMC3212423

We analysed the genotype, allele and haplotype distributions of two 5HT2AR gene variants in a population of 356 BPAD patients, which we compared with 208 healthy controls. We also carried out exploratory analysis in clinical subgroups of patients defined according to personal history of mood disorders, suicidal behaviour, comorbid psychiatric disorders and family history of affective disorders. We found no difference between BPAD patients and controls for allele, genotype and haplotype distributions. Exploratory analysis in subgroups of BPAD patients showed only a marginal difference in haplotype distribution between controls and BPAD patients with antidepressant-induced mania (P = 0.018). This difference was not significant after correction for multiple testing.

The lithium-induced decrease was greatest in BLCLs from female BD-I patients compared with those from healthy females (-27%) and with vehicle-treated BLCLs from female BD-I patients (-33%). However, lithium treatment did not affect TRPC1 and 3 mRNA levels, and TRPC1 immunoreactivity. Downregulation of TRPC3 may be an important mechanism by which lithium ameliorates pathophysiological Ca(2+) disturbances as observed in BD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no clear clinical outcome",10.1038/sj.tpj.6500266,"Adult;Analysis of Variance;B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism;Bipolar Disorder/*blood/drug therapy;Cells, Cultured;Female;Humans;Ion Channels/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood/genetics;Lithium/*administration & dosage;Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects;Male;Middle Aged;RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics;TRPC Cation Channels;Bipolar Disorder;Lithium",15354175,

METHODS: A phase II/III, Australian multi-site, 8-week, double-blind, RCT involving 158 outpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD. The intervention consisted of a nutraceutical combination: S-adenosyl methionine; Folinic acid; Omega-3 fatty acids; 5-HTP, Zinc picolinate, and relevant co-factors versus placebo. The primary outcome was change in MADRS score. Hypothesis-driven analyses of potential moderators of response involving key SNPs, and BDNF were also conducted. RESULTS: Placebo was superior to the nutraceutical combination in reducing MADRS score (differential reduction -1.75 points), however a mixed linear model revealed a non-significant Group X Time interaction (p = 0.33). Response rates were 40% for the active intervention and 51% for the placebo; remission rates were 34% and 43% for active and placebo groups, respectively.

We conducted a meta-analytic review of associations between genetic variations in the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) and PRL levels in antipsychotic-treated subjects. METHODS: Systematic literature search (5/8/2015) was performed to find published studies of pharmacogenetic associations between two DRD2 variants, Taq1A (rs1800497) and -141C Ins/Del (rs1799732), and PRL levels during antipsychotic treatment (excluding aripiprazole). Patients were included independent of age or diagnosis. Random effects models were used and Hedges' g was calculated as the effect size measure. Subgroup analyses explored the effect of sex and diagnosis, (males vs females; schizophrenia vs non-schizophrenia). RESULTS: Altogether, 11 studies (n=1034, schizophrenia-spectrum=475) for Taq1A polymorphism, and 4 studies (n=451, schizophrenia-spectrum=274) for -141C Ins/Del polymorphism, each reporting on PRL levels but not on the proportion of patients with hyperprolactinemia, were meta-analyzed. Across all patients, there was no statistically significant association between PRL levels and either DRD2 Taq1A genotype or DRD2 -141C Ins/Del genotype. However, in patients with schizophrenia, PRL levels were significantly higher in DRD2 Taq1A A1 carriers than A1 non-carriers (studies=5, n=475, Hedges' g=0.250, 95% CI=0.068-0.433, p=0.007, I(2)=0%). DISCUSSION: Although there was no significant association between either DRD2 Taq1A genotype or DRD2 -141C Ins/Del genotype and PRL levels in all included patients, our results suggest that DRD2 Taq1A genotype may affect antipsychotic-related PRL levels in patients with schizophrenia.

CYP2D6 is a liver enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used antipsychotic medications. We investigated if CYP2D6 genetic variation influenced weight or BMI among people taking antipsychotic treatment. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and a random effects meta-analysis of publications in Pubmed, Embase, PsychInfo, and CENTRAAL that had BMI and/or weight measurements of patients on long-term antipsychotics by their CYP2D6-defined metabolic groups (poor, intermediate, normal/extensive, and ultra-rapid metabolizers, UMs). RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the systematic review. All cohort studies suggested that the presence of reduced-function or non-functional alleles for CYP2D6 was associated with greater antipsychotic-induced weight gain, whereas most cross-sectional studies did not find any significant associations. Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis with clinical data of 2,041 patients, including 93 poor metabolizers (PMs), 633 intermediate metabolizers (IMs), 1,272 normal metabolizers (NMs), and 30 UMs. Overall, we did not find associations in any of the comparisons made. The estimated pooled standardized differences for the following comparisons were (i) PM versus NM; weight = -0.07 (95%CI: -0.49 to 0.35, p = 0.74), BMI = 0.40 (95%CI: -0.19 to 0.99, p = 0.19). (ii) IM versus NM; weight = 0.09 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.22, p = 0.16) and BMI = 0.09 (95% CI: -0.24 to 0.41, p = 0.60). (iii) UM versus EM; weight = 0.01 (95% CI: -0.37 to 0.40, p = 0.94) and BMI = -0.08 (95%CI: -0.57 to 0.42, p = 0.77). CONCLUSION: Our systematic review of cohort studies suggested that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have higher BMI than normal metabolizers, but the data of cross-sectional studies and the meta-analysis did not show this association. Although our review and meta-analysis constitutes one of the largest studies with comprehensively genotyped samples, the literature is still limited by small numbers of participants with genetic variants resulting in poor or UMs status. We need further studies with larger numbers of extreme metabolizers to establish its clinical utility in antipsychotic treatment.

PURPOSE: To test whether rs2067482 and rs72910092 are potential risk factors for schizophrenia and/or pharmacogenetic markers for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped DNA of 449 patients with schizophrenia and 134 healthy controls for rs2067482 and rs72910092 polymorphisms of the CHRM4 gene with the use of the MassARRAY(®) System by Agena Bioscience. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare qualitative traits and χ (2) test was used for categorical traits. RESULTS: The frequency of genotypes and alleles of rs72910092 did not differ between patients with schizophrenia and control subjects. We did not reveal any statistical differences for both rs2067482 and rs72910092 between schizophrenia patients with and without tardive dyskinesia. The frequency of the C allele of the polymorphic variant rs2067482 was significantly higher in healthy persons compared to patients with schizophrenia (OR=0.51, 95% CI [0.33-0.80]; p=0.003). Accordingly, the CC genotype was found significantly more often in healthy persons compared to patients with schizophrenia (OR=0.49, 95% CI [0.31-0.80]; p=0.010). CONCLUSION: Our study found the presence of the minor allele (T) of rs2067482 variant being associated with schizophrenia. We argue that the association of rs2067482 with schizophrenia may be via its regulatory effect on some other gene with protein kinase C and casein Kknase substrate in neurons 3 (PACSIN3) as a possible candidate.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous SNP infused at a rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min for 4 hours in patients with schizophrenia with some degree of treatment resistance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind acute treatment study using a sequential parallel comparison design conducted in two 2-week phases at 4 academic medical centers beginning May 20, 2015, and ending March 31, 2017. Participants were adults 18 to 65 years of age with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, taking antipsychotic medication for at least 8 weeks, and had at least 1 failed trial of an antipsychotic medication within the past year. A total of 90 participants consented, 60 participants enrolled, and 52 participants were included in the analyses. A modified intent-to-treat analysis was used. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment sequences: SNP and SNP, placebo and SNP, and placebo and placebo. The SNP and SNP group received SNP in phase 1 and SNP in phase 2 for the purpose of blinding, but the data from phase 2 were not included in the results. The placebo and SNP group received placebo in phase 1 and SNP in phase 2. If there was no response to placebo in phase 1, data from phase 2 were included in the analyses. The placebo and placebo group received placebo in both phases; if there was no response to placebo in phase 1, data from phase 2 were included in the analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effectiveness of SNP compared with placebo in improving Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, and negative scores across each 2-week phase. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants (12 women and 40 men) were included in the study. In the SNP and SNP group, the mean (SD) age was 47.1 (10.5) years. In the placebo and SNP group, the mean (SD) age was 45.9 (12.3) years. In the placebo and placebo group, the mean (SD) age was 40.4 (11.0) years.

Antipsychotic drugs upregulate lipogenic gene expression by disrupting intracellular trafficking of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol.,2010,10,,The pharmacogenomics journal,1473-1150 (Electronic),10,5,396-407,Kristiana I and Sharpe LJ and Catts VS and Lutze-Mann LH and Brown AJ,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19997082/,eng,,United States,"Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have been reported to induce lipogenic genes. This has been proposed to contribute to their efficacy in treating schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, as well as the metabolic side effects often associated with these drugs. The precise mechanism for the lipogenic effects of APDs is unknown, but is believed to involve increased activation of the lipogenic transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). In a series of experiments in a model cell line, we found that a panel of typical and atypical APDs inhibited transport of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which houses the cholesterol homeostatic machinery. APDs belong to the class of cationic amphiphiles and as has been shown for other amphiphiles, caused lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to accumulate intracellularly, preventing it from being esterified in the ER and suppressing SREBP activation. APDs did not activate the liver X receptor, another transcription factor involved in lipogenesis. However, these drugs markedly reduced cholesterol synthesis. This paradoxical result indicates that the upregulation of SREBP-target genes by APDs may not translate to increased cellular cholesterol levels. In conclusion, we have determined that APDs disrupt intracellular trafficking and synthesis of cholesterol, which may have important clinical ramifications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/tpj.2009.62,"Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Blotting, Western;CHO Cells;Cell Culture Techniques;Cholesterol/*biosynthesis;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Fatty Acids/biosynthesis;Gene Expression/*drug effects;Lipogenesis/*drug effects/genetics;Lipoproteins/*metabolism;Liver X Receptors;Orphan Nuclear Receptors/genetics;Plasmids;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Protein Transport;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2/*genetics;Transfection;Up-Regulation;Gene Expression;Antipsychotic Agents;Lipoprotein(a)",19997082,

The aim of this study was to investigate further the association of the genetic variations of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene with antidepressant-induced mania, already reported in recent studies. We also studied the possible association of these genetic variants with diagnosis expression and treatment response to lithium therapy. METHODS: The sample consisted of 103 and 85 outpatients with diagnosis of bipolar and unipolar disorder, respectively, and 101 controls. Two described polymorphisms of the 5-HTT, the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and serotonin transporter linked promoter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms, were genotyped using standard procedures. RESULTS: The association analysis performed showed a significantly higher rate of homozygous s/s genotype for 5-HTTLPR among patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania (60% patients s/s versus 40% l/l, chi, P=0.04). No significant difference in the distribution of genotypes of the two polymorphisms was observed between the three groups.

Several lines of evidence suggest a role for D3. Furthermore, an earlier meta-analysis by Jönsson et al. (2003) (n=233) suggested a role for genetic variation in the D3 gene.

In the present study we aimed to investigate the effect of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene on medium-term outcome in a naturalistic sample of 86 depressed bipolar spectrum patients, taking into account harm avoidance. Both single marker and haplotypes were significantly associated with severity of depression at month 6 after treatment initiation. The haplotype comprising the A-C alleles was associated with a poorer outcome. Harm avoidance maintained a significant effect on depressive outcome in bipolar disorder, independently from brain-derived neurotrophic factor genotypes.

The bibliometric data were also been correlated with some social and health data from Malaysia (total per capita expenditure on health and gross domestic expenditure on R&D). RESULTS: We found 105 original documents published between 2004 and 2016.

However, only a third of individuals experience remission after the first treatment. Common genetic variation, in part, likely regulates antidepressant response, yet the success of previous genome-wide association studies has been limited by sample size. This study performs the largest genetic analysis of prospectively assessed antidepressant response in major depressive disorder to gain insight into the underlying biology and enable out-of-sample prediction. METHODS: Genome-wide analysis of remission (n (remit) = 1852, n (nonremit) = 3299) and percentage improvement (n = 5218) was performed. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability was estimated using genome-wide complex trait analysis. Genetic covariance with eight mental health phenotypes was estimated using polygenic scores/AVENGEME. Out-of-sample prediction of antidepressant response polygenic scores was assessed. Gene-level association analysis was performed using MAGMA and transcriptome-wide association study. Tissue, pathway, and drug binding enrichment were estimated using MAGMA. RESULTS: Neither genome-wide association study identified genome-wide significant associations. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability was significantly different from zero for remission (h (2) = 0.132, SE = 0.056) but not for percentage improvement (h (2) = -0.018, SE = 0.032). Better antidepressant response was negatively associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia and positively associated with genetic propensity for educational attainment. Leave-one-out validation of antidepressant response polygenic scores demonstrated significant evidence of out-of-sample prediction, though results varied in external cohorts. Gene-based analyses identified ETV4 and DHX8 as significantly associated with antidepressant response. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that antidepressant response is influenced by common genetic variation, has a genetic overlap schizophrenia and educational attainment, and provides a useful resource for future research. Larger sample sizes are required to attain the potential of genetics for understanding and predicting antidepressant response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.07.008,Antidepressive Agents,35712048,PMC9117153

We initially established that the BICC1 promoter drove BICC1 mRNA expression in amygdala, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Intriguingly, we provide evidence that MDD associated polymorphisms alter the ability of the BICC1 promoter to respond to PKA signalling within amygdala neurones. Considering the known role of amygdala PKA pathways in fear learning and mood these observations suggest a possible mechanism through which allelic changes in the regulation of the BICC1 gene in amygdala neurones may contribute to mood disorders.

Low vitamin D (25-OH D) levels have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD. To investigate the therapeutic role of vitamin D in MDD, we recruited 62 male and female patients diagnosed with MDD and randomized them into two groups: the first group (49 patients) received vitamin D supplementation as cholecalciferol vitamin D(3) (50,000 I.U.) for 3 months, in addition to standard of care (SOC) which included pharmacological treatment and psychological support, and the second group (13 patients) received only SOC without vitamin D supplementation for 3 months. The Beck depression inventory (BDI) scale was used to assess the severity of MDD symptoms. Immunoassays were utilized to determine levels of serum vitamin D(3) and serotonin in all patients. The results showed significant gender differences; female patients showed the most improvement in their depressive symptoms after 3-month vitamin D supplementation. Females with moderate, severe, and extreme depression had significantly lower BDI scores after vitamin D treatment (p < 0.05). Among males, only those diagnosed with severe depression showed significant improvement in their BDI scores (p < 0.05). Serum serotonin levels were significantly increased after vitamin D supplementation compared to baseline in both male and female patients. No significant changes in other biochemical parameters were detected between the two groups.

The upregulated genes are all known to be controlled by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors. We show that clozapine and haloperidol both activate the SREBP system.

METHODS: The patients with schizophrenia were assessed for TD by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Eventually, 42 schizophrenics with persistent TD were in the TD group, and 59 schizophrenics without TD were in the non-TD group. The polymorphism of each candidate gene was analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: The genotype distributions of the candidate genes in the groups were all consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequencies for -759C/T and -697G/C polymorphisms in HTR2C gene showed a significant excess of -697 variant (P<0.05) in the patients with TD, compared against those in patients without TD. There were no differences in the distributions of the allelic frequencies and genotypes of Taq I. A polymorphism in DRD2 gene, of Ser/Gly polymorphism in DRD3 gene, and of Ala-9Val polymorphism in MnSOD gene between the TD group and non-TD group (P>0.05). Interestingly, as compared with the other joint allelic types, a significant excess of carrying both DRD3 variant allele (Gly) and MnSOD wild allele (Val) was found in the TD group (P<0.05). However, neither the allele and genotypes nor the clinical demographic characteristics contributed to the higher total AIMS scores in the patients of the TD group. There were no significant differences in any of the clinical demographic characteristics between the subgroups of any genotype in TD and non-TD groups. CONCLUSION: The excess of -697 variant in the promoter regulation region of the HTR2C gene may be a risk factor for the susceptibility to the occurrence of TD in Chinese male patients with schizophrenia. A combination of DRD3 variant allele (Gly) and MnSOD wild allele (Val) may increase the susceptibility to the development of TD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not in english",,"Aged;Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/etiology/*genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Variation;Genotype;Glycine/genetics;Haplotypes;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Mutation;Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C;Receptors, Dopamine D2/genetics;Receptors, Dopamine D3;Receptors, Serotonin/genetics;Schizophrenia/drug therapy;Superoxide Dismutase/genetics;Valine/genetics;Pharmacogenetics;Movement Disorders",12673575,

METHODS: This study is a post-hoc analysis of our cross-sectional study in Japanese outpatients with depressive disorder (ICD-10) (Ozawa et al., 2017). The participants received assessments with the Japanese version of the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (J-PDQ), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). First, multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the effects of demographic and clinical characteristics, including illness severity and medications (e.g., antidepressants and benzodiazepines), on the PDQ total score. Next, we categorized the participants into 4 groups based on the presence/absence of subjective and objective symptom remission (i.e., QIDS total score of ≤5 and MADRS total score of ≤9, respectively), and compared the differences in PDQ total scores between the QIDS- and MADRS-remitted group and the QIDS-non-remitted but MADRS-remitted group. RESULTS: 102 participants were included (45 men; mean ± SD age, 50.5 ± 14.7 years). Higher QIDS and MADRS total scores were significantly associated with a greater PDQ total score (both p's < 0.001), while other factors did not exhibit any associations. The QIDS-non-remitted but MADRS-remitted group showed a significantly higher PDQ total score than that of the QIDS- and MADRS-remitted group (median 10.0 [8.0-12.0] vs. 3.0 [range: 2.0-4.0], p < 0.001).

By using gene-based association analysis, we hope to identify genetic variants of HTR2A which are related to MDD susceptibility and its antidepressant therapeutic response. 288 HTR2A single nucleotide polymorphisms in MDD susceptibility have been investigated through a case-control (455 MDD patients and 2, 998 healthy controls) study, as well as in antidepressant efficacy (n = 455) in our current research. The 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was used to evaluate measures of antidepressant therapeutic efficacy. From two MDD groups in the antidepressant therapeutic response, by using gene-based analyses, we have identified 14 polymorphisms as suggestive markers for therapeutic response (13 for remission and 1 for response) in both meta- and mega-analyses. All of these HTR2A reported polymorphisms did not reach statistical significance in the case-control association study.

Lithium is the mainstay of treatment for Bipolar disorder (BD). There is limited literature on the clinical markers of Lithium treatment response from south Asia. METHODS: Two hundred and ten individuals with BD I and a history of at least 6 months of treatment with Lithium were recruited from the outpatient services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) after obtaining informed consent. A diagnosis of BD I was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. The characterization of response to lithium prophylaxis was done using NIMH Retrospective Life Chart and ""Retrospective Criteria of Long Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder"" scale. RESULTS: There were 132 (62.86%) good responders and 78 (37.14%) non-responders. Good responders were noted to have less number of hospitalizations and more onset episode of depression than non-responders. Using continuous phenotype, Lithium response was inversely correlated with total number of episodes, number of episodes of mania/ depression, number of hospitalisations and presence of suicide attempt. Multivariate analysis only revealed number of episodes and hospitalization to be associated with Lithium response. CONCLUSION: Our Lithium response rates were higher than what have been reported in the few previous studies. Illness severity was the only factor associated with Lithium response. There is a need to examine this question in larger prospective samples and to focus on biological/ molecular markers of treatment response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.ajp.2018.04.006,Adult;Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy;Female;Humans;India;Lithium Compounds/*therapeutic use;Male;Severity of Illness Index;Treatment Outcome;Bipolar Disorder,29636228,

The need for a detailed catalog of local variability motivated the whole-exome sequencing of 267 unrelated individuals, representative of the healthy Spanish population. Like in other studies, a considerable number of rare variants were found (almost one-third of the described variants). There were also relevant differences in allelic frequencies in polymorphic variants, including ∼10,000 polymorphisms private to the Spanish population. The allelic frequencies of variants conferring susceptibility to complex diseases (including cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes, and other pathologies) were overall similar to those of other populations. However, the trend is the opposite for variants linked to Mendelian and rare diseases (including several retinal degenerative dystrophies and cardiomyopathies) that show marked frequency differences between populations. Interestingly, a correspondence between differences in allelic frequencies and disease prevalence was found, highlighting the relevance of frequency differences in disease risk. These differences are also observed in variants that disrupt known drug binding sites, suggesting an important role for local variability in population-specific drug resistances or adverse effects. We have made the Spanish population variant server web page that contains population frequency information for the complete list of 170,888 variant positions we found publicly available (http://spv.babelomics.org/), We show that it if fundamental to determine population-specific variant frequencies to distinguish real disease associations from population-specific polymorphisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1093/molbev/msw005,"Databases, Nucleic Acid;Disease/*genetics;Drug Resistance/genetics;*Exome;Gene Frequency;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Variation;Genetics, Population/methods;Humans;Internet;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Polymorphism, Genetic;Spain/epidemiology",26764160,PMC4839216

This review identified 38 patients previously treated with venlafaxine immediate release or extended release and subsequently genotyped for the 2D6 gene with a commercial genotyping assay. Their dosage was examined along with their 2D6 genotype to determine whether the presence or absence of a fully functioning 2D6 allele was associated with their venlafaxine dosage.

METHODS: A total of 180 patients treated with risperidone-based (n=130) or clozapine-based (n=50) regimens were included in this study. Blood samples were analyzed for genotyping of the candidate genes and biochemical testing. Genotyping was performed by conducting a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction-based analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperglycemia was higher in patients receiving clozapine (64.0%) than in those receiving risperidone (30.8%).

RESULTS: We did not detect an association between tagging SNPs in HTR6 and the therapeutic response to SSRI in MDD in allele/genotype or haplotype analysis. CONCLUSIONS: HTR6 may not play an important role in the pathophysiology of SSRI response in the Japanese population.

The international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment for Depression (iSPOT-D) is a randomized clinical trial with enrollment from December 2008 to January 2012 at eight academic and nine private clinical settings in five countries. Patients (n=1008) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD and 336 matched healthy controls comprised the study sample. Six participants withdrew due to serious adverse events. Randomization was to 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine with dosage adjusted by the participant's treating clinician per routine clinical practice. Exposure to 18 types of traumatic events before the age of 18 was assessed using the Early-Life Stress Questionnaire. Impact of early-life stressors-overall trauma 'load' and specific type of abuse-on treatment outcomes measures: response: (⩾50% improvement on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, HRSD17 or on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Rated, QIDS_SR16) and remission (score ⩽7 on the HRSD17 and ⩽5 on the QIDS_SR16). Trauma prevalence in MDD was compared with controls. Depressed participants were significantly more likely to report early-life stress than controls; 62.5% of MDD participants reported more than two traumatic events compared with 28.4% of controls. The higher rate of early-life trauma was most apparent for experiences of interpersonal violation (emotional, sexual and physical abuses). Abuse and notably abuse occurring at ⩽7 years of age predicted poorer outcomes after 8 weeks of antidepressants, across the three treatment arms. In addition, the abuses occurring between ages 4 and 7 years differentially predicted the poorest outcome following the treatment with sertraline. Specific types of early-life trauma, particularly physical, emotional and sexual abuse, especially when occurring at ⩽7 years of age are important moderators of subsequent response to antidepressant therapy for MDD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/tp.2016.61,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Child;Child Abuse/*psychology;Depressive Disorder, Major/*complications/*drug therapy/psychology;Female;Humans;Internationality;Male;Middle Aged;Stress, Psychological/*complications/*psychology;Surveys and Questionnaires;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Antidepressive Agents",27138798,PMC5070060

Hypothesizing that DNA copy number exerts most effects via impacts on RNA expression, we attempted a novel in silico fine-mapping approach in non-CNV carriers using both GWAS and biobank data.

Using transcriptomic imputation, we performed association testing for CNV genes within large genotyped cohorts for schizophrenia, IQ, BMI, bipolar disorder, and ASD. Second, we used a biobank containing electronic health data to compare the medical phenome of CNV carriers to controls within 700,000 individuals in order to investigate the full spectrum of health effects of the CNVs. Third, we used genotypes for over 48,000 individuals within the biobank to perform phenome-wide association studies between imputed expressions of individual 16p11.2 and 22q11.2 genes and over 1500 health traits. RESULTS: Using large genotyped cohorts, we found individual genes within 16p11.2 associated with schizophrenia (TMEM219, INO80E, YPEL3), BMI (TMEM219, SPN, TAOK2, INO80E), and IQ (SPN), using conditional analysis to identify upregulation of INO80E as the driver of schizophrenia, and downregulation of SPN and INO80E as increasing BMI. We identified both novel and previously observed over-represented traits within the electronic health records of 16p11.2 and 22q11.2 CNV carriers. In the phenome-wide association study, we found seventeen significant gene-trait pairs, including psychosis (NPIPB11, SLX1B) and mood disorders (SCARF2), and overall enrichment of mental traits. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate how integration of genetic and clinical data aids in understanding CNV gene function and implicates pleiotropy and multigenicity in CNV biology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1186/s13073-021-00972-1,"Autism Spectrum Disorder/genetics;Autistic Disorder/*genetics;*Chromosome Deletion;*Chromosome Disorders;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics;*DNA Copy Number Variations;DiGeorge Syndrome/*genetics;Genotype;Humans;Intellectual Disability/genetics;Phenotype;Psychotic Disorders/genetics;Scavenger Receptors, Class F/genetics;Schizophrenia/genetics;*Transcriptome;Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics;Transcriptome",34715901,PMC8557010

METHODS: One thousand ninety manic patients included in the French National Study EPIMAN-II Mille were submitted to a cluster analysis on the basis of multiple variables related to the history of bipolar illness and symptoms of the current episode. RESULTS: Four clusters were identified: ""classic mania"" (29.3% of patients) with less severe mania; ""psychotic mania"" (22.7%) with psychotic symptoms, more severe mania, younger age and social impairment; ""depressive mania"" (30.4%) characterized by female gender, suicide attempts, high number of previous episodes and residual symptoms; and ""dual mania"" (17.6%) characterized by male gender, substance use, earlier onset and poor compliance. Patients groups also differed in manic symptoms, marital status, stressors preceding illness onset, prior diagnoses, first episode polarity and temperamental characteristics. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional assessment of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In comparing our findings with those of four prior cluster analytic studies, we integrate clinical characteristics of mania subtypes found in this very large representative French sample in contemporary practice, we suggest how such convergence of data may help improve earlier recognition, differential response to different treatments, and prevention of these subtypes.

The antipsychotic clozapine, the only licensed medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is under-prescribed and has high rates of discontinuation in individuals of African ancestry, due in part to increased rates of neutropenia. The genetic basis of lower neutrophil levels in those of African ancestry has not previously been investigated in the context of clozapine treatment. We sought to identify risk alleles in the first genome-wide association study of neutrophil levels during clozapine treatment, in 552 individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and robustly inferred African genetic ancestry. Two genome-wide significant loci were associated with low neutrophil counts during clozapine treatment. The most significantly associated locus was driven by rs2814778 (β = -0.9, P = 4.21 × 10(-21)), a known regulatory variant in the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene. Individuals homozygous for the C allele at rs2814778 were significantly more likely to develop neutropenia and have to stop clozapine treatment (OR = 20.4, P = 3.44 × 10(-7)). This genotype, also termed ""Duffy-null"", has previously been shown to be associated with lower neutrophil levels in those of African ancestry. Our results indicate the relevance of the rs2814778 genotype for those taking clozapine and its potential as a pharmacogenetic test, dependent on the outcome of additional safety studies, to assist decision making in the initiation and on-going management of clozapine treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41380-018-0335-7,"Alleles;Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Blacks/genetics;Clozapine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects;Duffy Blood-Group System/genetics;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Humans;Male;Neutropenia/blood/*chemically induced/*genetics;Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism/pathology;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/genetics;Genome;Genotype;Neutropenia;Genomics",30647433,

The FPG represent evidence-based decision support for practitioners providing care to adults with MDD. PARTICIPANTS: The consensus meeting included representatives from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA), advocacy members, academic experts in MDD, and multidisciplinary mental health clinicians, as well as health policy experts. The FAHCA provided funding support for the FPG. EVIDENCE: Evidence was limited to results from adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; in addition, pooled-, meta-, and network-analyses were included. Recommendations were based on consensus arrived at by the multistakeholder Florida Expert Panel. Articles selected were identified on the electronic search engine PubMed with the dates 2010 to present. The search terms were major depressive disorder, psychopharmacology, antidepressants, psychotherapy, neuromodulation, complementary alternative medicines, pooled-analysis, meta-analysis, and network-analysis. Bibliographies of the identified articles were manually searched for additional citations not identified in the original search. CONSENSUS PROCESS: A consensus meeting comprising all representatives took place on September 25-26, 2015, in Tampa, Florida. Guiding principles (eg, emphasis on the most rigorous evidence for efficacy, safety, and tolerability) were discussed, defined, and operationalized prior to review of extant data. As MDD often pursues a recurrent and chronic course, principles of practice, measurement-based care, and comprehensive assessment and management of overall physical and mental health were emphasized. Evidence supporting pretreatment major depressive episode specifiers (eg, mixed features, anxious distress) and the role of pharmacogenomics (and other biological-behavioral markers) in informing treatment selection were comprehensively discussed. Algorithmic priority was assigned to agents with relatively greater therapeutic index (ie, efficacy) and minimal propensity for safety and tolerability disadvantages. CONCLUSIONS: The updated 2015 FPG provide concise, pragmatic, evidence-based decision support for treatment selection and sequencing for adults with MDD. Principles of practice include measurement-based care, priority to both psychiatric and medical comorbidity, identification of DSM-5-defined specifiers (eg, mixed features), suicide risk assessment, and evaluation of cognitive symptoms. The FPG have purposefully aimed to minimize emphasis on ""expert opinion"" and instead differentially emphasized extant evidence for pharmacologic treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.4088/JCP.16cs10885,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use;*Consensus Development Conferences as Topic;Depressive Disorder, Major/classification/diagnosis/*therapy;Evidence-Based Medicine/*standards;Florida;Humans;Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder",28682531,

However, a meta-analysis on the efficacy of steroids in treating these coronavirus infections is lacking. (2) Purpose: We assessed a methodological criticism on the quality of previous published meta-analyses and the risk of misleading conclusions with important therapeutic consequences. We also examined the evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in SARS, MERS and COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were used to identify studies published until 25 April 2020, that reported associations between steroid use and mortality in treating SARS/MERS/COVID-19. Two investigators screened and extracted data independently. Searches were restricted to studies on humans, and articles that did not report the exact number of patients in each group or data on mortality were excluded. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) under the fixed- and random-effect model. (4) Results: Eight articles (4051 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Among these selected studies, 3416 patients were diagnosed with SARS, 360 patients with MERS, and 275 with COVID-19; 60.3% patients were administered steroids. The meta-analyses including all studies showed no differences overall in terms of mortality (OR 1.152, 95% CI 0.631-2.101 in the random effects model, p = 0.645). However, this conclusion might be biased, because, in some studies, the patients in the steroid group had more severe symptoms than those in the control group. In contrast, when the meta-analysis was performed restricting only to studies that used appropriate adjustment (e.g., time, disease severity), there was a significant difference between the two groups (HR 0.378, 95% CI 0.221-0.646 in the random effects model, p < 0.0001). Although there was no difference in mortality when steroids were used in severe cases, there was a difference among the group with more underlying diseases (OR 3.133, 95% CI 1.670-5.877, p < 0.001). (5) Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis providing the most accurate evidence on the effect of steroids in coronavirus infections. If not contraindicated, and in the absence of side effects, the use of steroids should be considered in coronavirus infection including COVID-19.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3390/jcm9082392,Adrenal Cortex Hormones,32726951,PMC7465945

FTO gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity, but the available scientific data concerning their relationship to antipsychotic drug-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome is still incomplete and inconsistent, which indicates that continuing the investigation of this gene's role is necessary. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, 517 patients with schizophrenia underwent antipsychotic drug treatment, and two groups were identified: patients with MetS and without MetS. Genotyping of 6 SNPs in the FTO gene was performed, and the results analyzed using R-programme. RESULTS: We performed a statistical analysis to identify possible associations of the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the studied polymorphisms with the presence of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients, with the presence of abdominal obesity, and with an increased body mass index. The rs7185735 polymorphism did not meet the Hardy-Weinberg criterion and was excluded. After correcting for differences in age, gender and duration of illnesses, none of the variants was shown to be related to metabolic syndrome or abdominal obesity, but rs9939609, rs1421085, rs3751812 and rs8050136 were associated with body mass index.

Our candidate gene study suggests the involvement of NOS1AP and NUBPL (P-values=1.45 × 10(-05) and 2.66 × 10(-13), respectively). Furthermore, our top GWAS hit achieving genome-wide significance, defined as a Q-value <0.10 (P-value=1.54 × 10(-7), Q-value=0.07), located in SLC22A23, mediated the effects of quetiapine on prolongation. SLC22A23 belongs to a family of organic ion transporters that shuttle a variety of compounds, including drugs, environmental toxins and endogenous metabolites, across the cell membrane. This gene is expressed in the heart and is integral in mouse heart development. The genes mediating antipsychotic-induced QT prolongation partially overlap with the genes affecting normal QT interval variation.

CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes comprise poor metabolizers (PM), intermediate and intermediate+ metabolizers (IM; IM+), extensive and extensive+ metabolizers (EM [wild type]; EM+) and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM) defined by the two most common CYP2C19 functional polymorphisms (rs4244285 and rs12248560) in Caucasians. These polymorphisms were genotyped or imputed from genome-wide data in four samples treated with citalopram or escitalopram (GENDEP, STAR*D, GenPod, PGRN-AMPS). Treatment efficacy was assessed by standardized percentage symptom improvement and by remission. Side effect data were available at weeks 2-4, 6 and 9 in three samples. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed using EM as the reference group. Analysis of 2558 patients for efficacy and 2037 patients for side effects showed that PMs had higher symptom improvement (SMD = 0.43, CI = 0.19-0.66) and higher remission rates (OR = 1.55, CI = 1.23-1.96) compared to EMs. At weeks 2-4, PMs showed higher risk of gastro-intestinal (OR = 1.26, CI = 1.08-1.47), neurological (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.07-1.53) and sexual side effects (OR = 1.52, CI = 1.23-1.87; week 6 values were similar).

RESULTS: The following concentrations (ng/mL) were noted in the group receiving active IV infusion (IV-POS group, n = 27) of racemic CIT on day 10, before drug administration: escitalopram (S-CIT): 24 ± 10.2; R-citalopram (R-CIT): 45 ± 14.5; S-desmethyl-CIT: 13 ± 4.4; and R-desmethyl-CIT: 17 ± 8.2. In patients receiving oral administration (POS-POS group, n = 25), the values were 30 ± 12.7, 51 ± 17.4, 13 ± 4.6, and 17 ± 7.9 ng/mL, respectively. In the IV-POS group, 3 patients were poor dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) metabolizers; in the POS-POS group, one was a poor mephenytoin (CYP2C19) metabolizer. On day 10, before CIT treatment, S/R-CIT and S/R-mephenytoin ratios were significantly correlated, determined at baseline. Overall, CIT reduced the heart rate but did not significantly modify QTc. No relationship was found between any cardiovascular parameters and pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic data. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to CIT's high bioavailability, the plasma concentrations of its enantiomers remained largely independent on the administration route. CYP2C19 preferentially demethylated S-CIT after CIT therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1097/FTD.0000000000000824,"*Citalopram/blood/pharmacokinetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy;Dextromethorphan;Humans;Mephenytoin;Phenotype;Citalopram",33060488,
D2 receptor genetic variation and clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment: a meta-analysis.,2010,7,,The American journal of psychiatry,1535-7228 (Electronic),167,7,763-72,Zhang JP and Lencz T and Malhotra AK,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20194480/,eng,,,"OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence suggest that antipsychotic drug efficacy is mediated by dopamine type 2 (D(2)) receptor blockade. Therefore, it seems plausible that variation in the DRD(2) gene is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment. The authors conducted the first meta-analysis to examine the relationship between DRD2 polymorphisms and antipsychotic drug response. METHOD: A MEDLINE search of articles available up to December 31, 2008, yielded 18 prospective studies examining DRD2 gene variation and antipsychotic response in schizophrenia patients; of which, 10 independent studies met criteria for inclusion. Clinical response to antipsychotic treatment was defined as a 50% reduction of either the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at approximately 8 weeks of follow-up evaluation. Odds ratio was the primary effect-size measure and computed for each polymorphism in each study. Sufficient data were available for two DRD2 polymorphisms: -141C Ins/Del and Taq1A. RESULTS: Six studies reported results for the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism (total sample size: N=687). The Del allele carrier was significantly associated with poorer antipsychotic drug response relative to the Ins/Ins genotype. Eight studies assessed the Taq1A polymorphism and antipsychotic response (total sample size: N=748). There was no significant difference in the response rate among A1 allele carriers relative to individuals with the A2/A2 genotype or A2 allele carriers relative to individuals with the A1/A1 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The DRD2 genetic variation is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment.

None of the haplotypes consisting of six SNPs in the PDE1A have a significant difference between depressed and control groups. Among haplotypes consisting of 16 SNPs across 440 kb in the PDE11A gene, 18 common haplotypes (with frequency higher than 0.8%) have been found in the studied population. Six haplotypes showed significantly different frequencies between the MDD group and the control group. The phylogenetic network result for the 16 SNPs showed that several historic recombination events have happened in the PDE11A gene. The frequency of one haplotype is significantly lower in the remitter group than in the nonremitter group for the depressed participants treated with either desipramine or fluoxetine.

Functional variants in the gene may influence susceptibility to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) induced by antipsychotic drugs. To further investigate our previous report of association of the RGS2 gene with susceptibility to antipsychotic-induced EPS, we performed a replication study. EPS were rated in 184 US patients with schizophrenia (115 African Americans, 69 Caucasian) treated for at least a month with typical antipsychotic drugs (n=45), risperidone (n=46), olanzapine (n=50) or clozapine (n=43). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or flanking RGS2 were genotyped (rs1933695, rs2179652, rs2746073, rs4606, rs1819741 and rs1152746). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. Our results indicate association of SNP rs4606 with antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP), as measured by the Simpson Angus scale, in the overall sample and in the African-American subsample, the G (minor) allele having a protective effect. ORs for AIP among rs4606 G-allele carriers were 0.23 (95% CI 0.10-0.54, P=0.001) in the overall sample, and 0.20 (0.07-0.57, P=0.003) in the African-American subsample. In the previously studied Israeli sample the OR was 0.31 (0.11-0.84, P=0.02). We completely sequenced the RGS2 gene in nine patients with AIP and nine patients without, from the Israeli sample. No common coding polymorphisms or additional regulatory variants were revealed, suggesting that association of the rs4606 C/G polymorphism with AIP is biologically meaningful and not a consequence of linkage disequilibrium with another functional variant. Taken together, the findings of the current study support the association of RGS2 with AIP and focus on a possible protective effect of the minor G allele of SNP rs4606. This SNP is located in the 3'-regulatory region of the gene, and is known to influence RGS2 mRNA levels and protein expression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""}",10.1038/tpj.2008.6,"*3' Untranslated Regions;Adult;African Americans/genetics;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Cross-Sectional Studies;DNA Mutational Analysis;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Haplotypes;Humans;Israel;Logistic Models;Male;Odds Ratio;Parkinson Disease, Secondary/*chemically induced/ethnology/*genetics/prevention &           control;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;RGS Proteins/*genetics;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/*drug therapy;United States;Whites/genetics",18347610,

Over the past 60 years, pharmaceutical companies have successfully demonstrated the safety and efficacy of over 1,200 novel therapeutic drugs via costly clinical studies. While this process must continue, better use can be made of the existing valuable data. In silico tools such as candidate gene prediction systems allow rapid identification of disease genes by identifying the most probable candidate genes linked to genetic markers of the disease or phenotype under investigation. Integration of drug-target data with candidate gene prediction systems can identify novel phenotypes which may benefit from current therapeutics. Such a drug repositioning tool can save valuable time and money spent on preclinical studies and phase I clinical trials. METHODS: We previously used Gentrepid (http://www.gentrepid.org) as a platform to predict 1,497 candidate genes for the seven complex diseases considered in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium genome-wide association study; namely Type 2 Diabetes, Bipolar Disorder, Crohn's Disease, Hypertension, Type 1 Diabetes, Coronary Artery Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Here, we adopted a simple approach to integrate drug data from three publicly available drug databases: the Therapeutic Target Database, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase and DrugBank; with candidate gene predictions from Gentrepid at the systems level. RESULTS: Using the publicly available drug databases as sources of drug-target association data, we identified a total of 428 candidate genes as novel therapeutic targets for the seven phenotypes of interest, and 2,130 drugs feasible for repositioning against the predicted novel targets. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating genetic, bioinformatic and drug data, we have demonstrated that currently available drugs may be repositioned as novel therapeutics for the seven diseases studied here, quickly taking advantage of prior work in pharmaceutics to translate ground-breaking results in genetics to clinical treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""}",10.1186/1755-8794-7-S1-S8,"Databases, Pharmaceutical;Disease/*genetics;Drug Approval;Drug Discovery;Feasibility Studies;Genetic Loci/genetics;*Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration;Genomics;Genome",25077696,PMC4101352

We confirmed a better and faster response in our depressed patients bearing the *l variant, but we also found significant differences in response among *l carriers according to the type of *l allele. In fact, 16F *l carriers showed only a partial response, while 16D *l carriers showed a marginally significantly better response than 16A *l allele carriers.

All patients were administered with lithium as prophylactic therapy and they were prospectively observed for at least 3 years. Subjects were typed for their SERTPR variant using polymerase chain reaction techniques. SERTPR variants were associated with lithium outcome among those subjects who had few manic episodes before lithium treatment and, as a trend, among subjects who received a high daily dose of lithium (> or =1200 mg/die). In both cases, subjects with the l/l variant showed a higher probability to develop an illness episode within 3 years of prophylactic treatment with lithium. The present study confirmed our previous observation of a better response of SERTPR*l/s carriers, but could not confirm a poor efficacy in subjects with the SERTPR*s/s genotype. Notwithstanding the conflicting results, SERTPR variants are a possible liability factor for lithium long-term efficacy in mood disorders.

RESULTS: The early treatment response trajectories were classified into a high-trajectory group of better responders and a low-trajectory group of worse responders. The results of trajectory analysis showed differences compared with the classification method characterised by a 50% reduction in PANSS scores at week 6. A total of 349 patients were inconsistently grouped by the two methods, with a significant difference in the composition ratio of treatment response groups using these two methods (χ2 = 43.37, P < 0.001). There was no differential contribution of high- and low trajectories to different drugs (χ2 = 12.52, P = 0.051); olanzapine and risperidone, which had a larger proportion in the >50% reduction at week 6, performed better than aripiprazole, quetiapine, ziprasidone and perphenazine.

Unfortunately, SGAs are often associated with substantial weight gain, with no means to predict which patients are at greatest risk. OBJECTIVE: To identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with antipsychotic drug–induced weight gain. DESIGN: Pharmacogenetic association study. SETTING: The discovery cohort was from a US general psychiatric hospital. Three additional cohorts were from psychiatric hospitals in the United States and Germany and from a European antipsychotic drug trial. PARTICIPANTS: The discovery cohort consisted of 139 pediatric patients undergoing first exposure to SGAs. The 3 additional cohorts consisted of 73, 40, and 92 subjects. INTERVENTION: Patients in the discovery cohort were treated with SGAs for 12 weeks. Additional cohorts were treated for 6 and 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We conducted a genomewide association study assessing weight gain associated with 12 weeks of SGA treatment in patients undergoing first exposure to antipsychotic drugs. We next genotyped 3 independent cohorts of subjects assessed for antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain. RESULTS: Our genome-wide association study yielded 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms at a single locus exceeding a statistical threshold of P<10(-5). This locus, near the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene, overlaps a region previously identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies of obesity in the general population. Effects were recessive, with minor allele homozygotes gaining extreme amounts of weight during the 12-week trial. These results were replicated in 3 additional cohorts, with rs489693 demonstrating consistent recessive effects; meta-analysis revealed a genome-wide significant effect (P=5.59 X 10 (-12). Moreover, we observed consistent effects on related metabolic indices, including triglyceride, leptin, and insulin levels.

However, the specific processes through which therapeutic effects occur and are maintained in bipolar disorder remain unclear. This paper provides a timely update to an authoritative review of pertinent findings that was published in CNS Drugs in 2013. A literature search was conducted using the Scopus database, and was limited by year (from 2012). There has been a resurgence of interest in lithium therapy mechanisms, perhaps driven by technical advancements in recent years that permit the examination of cellular mechanisms underpinning the effects of lithium-along with the reuptake of lithium in clinical practice. Recent research has further cemented glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) inhibition as a key mechanism, and the inter-associations between GSK3β-mediated neuroprotective, anti-oxidative and neurotransmission mechanisms have been further elucidated. In addition to highly illustrative cellular research, studies examining higher-order biological systems, such as circadian rhythms, as well as employing innovative animal and human models, have increased our understanding of how lithium-induced changes at the cellular level possibly translate to changes at behavioural and clinical levels. Neural circuitry research is yet to identify clear mechanisms of change in bipolar disorder in response to treatment with lithium, but important structural findings have demonstrated links to the modulation of cellular mechanisms, and peripheral marker and pharmacogenetic studies are showing promising findings that will likely inform the exploration for predictors of lithium treatment response. With a deeper understanding of lithium's therapeutic mechanisms-from the cellular to clinical levels of investigation-comes the opportunity to develop predictive models of lithium treatment response and identify novel drug targets, and recent findings have provided important leads towards these goals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s40263-016-0380-1,Antimanic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Apoptosis/drug effects;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism;Humans;Lithium Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Nerve Net/drug effects;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Signal Transduction/*drug effects;Bipolar Disorder;Lithium,27638546,

We aimed to assess the effects of pimavanserin, a selective 5-HT(2A) inverse agonist and antagonist, on negative symptoms of schizophrenia. METHODS: The ADVANCE study was a phase 2, 26-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pimavanserin in stable outpatients with schizophrenia aged 18-55 years with predominant negative symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) across 83 sites (18 in North America and 65 in Europe) to receive pimavanserin or placebo daily, added to an ongoing antipsychotic medication, per a computer-generated schedule (stratification by geographical region). Eligible patients had a score of at least 20 on the sum of seven Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Marder negative factor items (and scores of ≥4 on at least three or ≥5 on at least two of negative symptom items). The starting dosage of 20 mg of pimavanserin or placebo could be adjusted to 34 mg or 10 mg within the first 8 weeks of the study, after which dosage remained stable until the end of the study. Both pimavanserin and placebo were administered orally once daily as two individual tablets (pimavanserin tablets were either 10 mg or 17 mg). The primary endpoint was change in total score using the 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-16) from baseline to week 26. Primary outcomes were analysed in patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had NSA-16 assessments at baseline and at least once post-baseline (full analysis set). Safety outcomes were analysed in patients who had received at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02970305, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2016, and April 16, 2019, we randomly assigned 403 patients to pimavanserin (n=201; 131 [65%] male; 187 [93%] White) or placebo (n=202; 137 [68%] male, 186 (92%) White), of whom 400 were included in the efficacy analysis (199 in the pimavanserin group, 201 in the placebo group). Mean age was 37·7 years (SD 9·4) in the pimavanserin group and 36·7 (9·2) years in the placebo group. The change in total NSA-16 score from baseline to week 26 was significantly improved with pimavanserin (least squares mean -10·4 [SE 0·67]) versus placebo (least squares mean -8·5 [0·67]; p=0·043; effect size: 0·211). The number of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between groups: 80 (40%) patients experienced TEAEs in the pimavanserin group and 71 (35%) in the placebo group. Most TEAEs were headache (6% [n=13] vs 5% [n=10]) and somnolence (5% [n=11] vs 5% [n=10]). One patient from the placebo group reported severe headache (0·5%), rhinorrhoea (0·5%), cough (0·5%), and influenza (0·5%). In the pimavanserin group, one patient reported severe toothache (0·5%), and two patients had worsening of schizophrenia (1%). Mean change in QTcF interval was higher with pimavanerin (4·5 ms [SD 18·0]) than with placebo (0·0 ms [16·0]). INTERPRETATION: Stable patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia showed a reduction in negative symptoms after treatment with pimavanserin. However, given the small effect size, further investigation with optimised dosing is warranted to determine the clinical significance of this effect.

This study aimed to examine changes in miRNA expression in bipolar mania patients after treatment with asenapine and risperidone. Using a miRNA microarray, we analyzed miRNA expression in the blood of 10 bipolar mania patients following 12 weeks of treatment with asenapine or risperidone. Selected miRNAs were validated by using real-time PCR. A total of 16 miRNAs were differentially expressed after treatment in the asenapine group, 14 of which were significantly upregulated and the other two significantly downregulated. However, all three differentially expressed miRNAs in the risperidone group were downregulated. MiRNA target gene prediction and gene ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment for pathways associated with immune system response and regulation of programmed cell death and transcription.

cDNA array reveals increased expression of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide following chronic clozapine treatment: role in atypical antipsychotic drug-induced adverse metabolic effects.,2006,3,,The pharmacogenomics journal,1470-269X (Print),6,2,131-40,Sondhi S and Castellano JM and Chong VZ and Rogoza RM and Skoblenick KJ and Dyck BA and Gabriele J and Thomas N and Ki K and Pristupa ZB and Singh AN and MacCrimmon D and Voruganti P and Foster J and Mishra RK,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16402076/,eng,,United States,"Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with unique pharmacological and therapeutic properties. Unlike the typical antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, clozapine does not cause extrapyramidal side effects; however, weight gain, dyslipidemia, and type II diabetes are commonly associated with the use of this drug in subjects with schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to profile gene expression in the rat striatum following clozapine treatment. Chronic treatment with clozapine revealed upregulation of several genes including the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) gene by over 200% in the rat striatum. The cDNA array results for the GIP gene were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR as well as by radioimmunoassay. Expression of the GIP gene in the central nervous system is consistent with the results of retinal GIP gene expression as reported by other investigators. Taken together, these findings implicate the possible role of GIP as a neuromodulator in the central nervous system. GIP is an insulinotropic agent with stimulatory effects on insulin synthesis and release from the pancreas. However, changes in brain GIP levels are most likely unrelated to the metabolic adverse effects (dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, weight gain) associated with clozapine treatment. Therefore, we also measured GIP gene expression in the K-cell-rich regions, duodenum and jejunum (small intestine), and plasma GIP levels using radioimmunoassay following chronic treatment with clozapine. GIP mRNA levels in the small intestine and the plasma GIP at the protein level were significantly elevated in clozapine-treated subjects. Furthermore, as observed in humans, chronic clozapine treatment also caused weight gain, and increased levels of insulin, triglycerides and leptin in the plasma. These results suggest that adverse metabolic effects associated with clozapine treatment may be related to its ability to increase intestinal gene expression for GIP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1038/sj.tpj.6500346,"Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Base Sequence;Clozapine/*adverse effects;Corpus Striatum/drug effects/*metabolism;Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide/blood/*genetics;Gene Expression/*drug effects;Immunohistochemistry;Intestine, Small/drug effects/*metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Antipsychotic Agents;DNA, Complementary",16402076,

However, the functional impact of habenular cholinergic signaling on the specified depressive behaviors is not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that the expression levels of cholinergic signaling genes (CHAT, VACHT, CHT, CHRNA3, CHRNB3 and CHRNB4) were down-regulated in a chronic restraint stress (CRS) rat model of depression, in which rats display depression-like behaviors such as anhedonia and mood despair. Moreover, knockdown of CHAT in the rat habenula was sufficient to evoke anhedonia-like behavior. The anhedonia-like behavior induced by CHAT knockdown was not reversed by chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. To determine whether habenular cholinergic signaling is associated with regulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), we used CHAT::cre transgenic mice expressing the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD). Pharmacogenetic activation of habenular cholinergic neurons induces the excitation of dopamine neurons in the VTA and reduces the immunoreactivity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the DRN.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age on zuclopenthixol exposure during oral and LAI administrations without and with adjustment for CYP2D6 genotype. METHODS: Data on serum concentrations of zuclopenthixol and CYP2D6 genotype (available for 28.2% of the population) from patients using oral or LAI zuclopenthixol were included retrospectively from a therapeutic drug monitoring service during the period 2005-2019. As a measure of exposure, dose-adjusted serum concentration (C/D ratio) was used. Based on age, patients were grouped to older (≥ 65 years) or younger (18-64 years). Linear mixed model analyses without and with adjustment for CYP2D6 genotype were used. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of zuclopenthixol from 1145 (14.1% older) and 899 patients (24.6% older) in the LAI and oral groups were included, respectively. Compared with younger patients, older patients had a higher C/D ratio of zuclopenthixol for LAI (+ 25-33%, p < 0.001) and oral formulation (+ 25-29%, p ≤ 0.003) without and with adjustment for CYP2D6 genotype. The doses were lower in older versus younger patients (oral: - 30%; LAI: - 20%; p < 0.001). Compared with the younger LAI users without reduced CYP2D6 function, a higher C/D ratio was observed in the older LAI users with reduced CYP2D6 function (+ 104%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that zuclopenthixol exposure increases in older patients and that the older LAI users with reduced CYP2D6 function are exposed to high serum concentrations. Also, the present study showed that similar dose reductions are required for oral and LAI users.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1007/s00228-020-03002-y,"Administration, Oral;Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics;Clopenthixol/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/metabolism;Delayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Female;Humans;Injections;Male;Middle Aged;Norway;Pharmacogenomic Variants;Retrospective Studies;Schizophrenia/blood/*drug therapy;Young Adult;Genotype;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Clopenthixol",33000414,

The CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, major enzymes implicated in Clz metabolism, present an interethnic variation on their activity caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The present study investigated the influence of genetic and nongenetic factors on Clz pharmacokinetics in a southern Mediterranean population. We included adult Tunisian schizophrenic patients having received Clz and undergone a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Clz by morning C0 monitoring. The genomic DNA was extracted using a salting-out procedure. CYP1A2*1F (rs762551;-163C>A), CYP1A2*1C (rs2069514;-3860 G>A) and CYP 2C19*2 (rs4244285; 681G>A) was analyzed using PCR-RFLP. Fifty-one patients were enrolled in the study. The mutant allele (CYP1A2*1F) was the most frequently detected (58.8%). For CYP1A2*1F, Clz dose-normalized (C0/D ratio) was as high as 1.28 ± 0.37 in CC versus 0.67 ± 0.32 ng mL(-1) per mg day(-1) in AA group (p < 0.001). The influence of genetic (CYP1A2*1F, CYP1A2*1C and CYP2C19*2) and nongenetic parameters (age, weight, gender, tobacco, coffee, and alcohol consumption) on the variation of the Clz C0/D ratio was investigated. Only the CYP1A2*1 F polymorphism correlates significantly with the Clz C0/D variation and could explain 24% of its variability. Our data support a critical role of the CYP1A2 -163C>A on the variation of Clz exposure in Tunisian schizophrenic patients. Considering its narrow therapeutic range, CYP1A2 genotyping combined with TDM of Clz may improve efficacy and safety of this drug.

However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate whether common genetic variations in these two genes are associated with MDD and therapeutic response to antidepressants in the Chinese population. METHODS: Three polymorphisms including rs531564 (a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] in MIR124-1), rs10759 (a microRNA-binding site SNP in RGS4), and rs951436 (a promoter SNP in RGS4) were genotyped in 225 Chinese MDD patients and 436 controls. Among the MDD patients, 147 accepted antidepressant treatment for 8 weeks with therapeutic evaluation at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, and week 8 using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to identify gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: No significant association with MDD was discovered in single-SNP analyses. However, by MDR analysis, the three-locus model of gene-gene interaction was the best for predicting MDD risk. In pharmacogenetic study, a significant association was found in genotypic frequencies of rs951436 between the remitter and non-remitter groups (p=0.026, correction p=0.078). For further analysis, the rs951436 heterozygote carriers had threefold probabilities of achieving clinical complete remission (odds ratio =3.00, 95% confidence interval =1.33-6.76, p=0.007, correction p=0.021) as compared with rs951436 homozygotes (AA+CC) after 8 weeks of treatment.

As one example, a predictive test for tardive dyskinesia (TD) (an adverse drug reaction consequent to antipsychotic exposure) could greatly improve the clinical treatment of schizophrenia but human studies are equivocal. A complementary approach is the mouse-then-human design in which a valid mouse model is used to identify susceptibility loci, which are subsequently tested in human samples. We used inbred mouse strains from the Mouse Phenome Project to estimate the heritability of haloperidol-induced activity and orofacial phenotypes. In all, 159 mice from 27 inbred strains were chronically treated with haloperidol (3 mg kg(-1) per day via subdermal slow-release pellets) and monitored for the development of vacuous chewing movements (VCMs; the mouse analog of TD) and other movement phenotypes derived from open-field activity and the inclined screen test. The test battery was assessed at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days in relation to haloperidol exposure. As expected, haloperidol caused marked changes in VCMs, activity in the open field and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Unexpectedly, factor analysis demonstrated that these measures were imprecise assessments of a latent construct rather than discrete constructs. The heritability of a composite phenotype was ∼0.9 after incorporation of the longitudinal nature of the design. Murine VCMs are a face valid animal model of antipsychotic-induced TD, and heritability estimates from this study support the feasibility of mapping of susceptibility loci for VCMs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1038/tpj.2010.82,"Animals;Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects;Haloperidol/*adverse effects;Male;Mastication/*drug effects/genetics;Mice;Mice, Inbred Strains;Antipsychotic Agents;Mastication",21079646,PMC3117923

This cross-sectional study aimed at investigating ARNTL and MAOA gene expression differences (1) between individuals with BD and controls, (2) between affective episodes, and (3) the relationship between ARNTL and MAOA expression. METHODS: ARNTL and MAOA gene expression in peripheral mononuclear blood cells were analysed from fasting blood samples (BD n =  81, controls n = 54) with quantitative real-time PCR operating on TaqMan® assays (normalised to 18S RNA expression). ANCOVAs corrected for age, sex, body mass index, and medication was used to evaluate expression differences and correlation analyses for the relation between ARNTL and MAOA expression. RESULTS: ARNTL gene expression differed between affective episodes (F(2,78) = 3.198, p = 0.047, Partial Eta(2)= 0.083), but not between BD and controls (n.s.). ARNTL and MAOA expression correlated positively in BD (r = 0.704, p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.932, p < 0.001). MAOA expression differed neither between BD and controls nor between affective episodes (n.s.). DISCUSSION: Clock gene expression changes were observed in different affective states of BD. More precisely, ARNTL gene expression was significantly higher in euthymia than in depression. ARNTL and MAOA gene expression correlated significantly in BD and in controls, which emphasises the strong concatenation between circadian rhythms and neurotransmitter breakdown.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1080/15622975.2021.1973816,Bipolar Disorder;Gene Expression,34468263,
High impact child abuse may predict risk of elevated suicidality during antidepressant initiation.,2013,12,,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,1440-1614 (Electronic),47,12,1191-5,Singh AB and Bousman CA and Ng CH and Berk M,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24280998/,eng,,England,"BACKGROUND: Concerns have emerged that initiation of an antidepressant can lead to or exacerbate suicidality. If those more at risk could be identified prior to treatment, treatment risk benefit analysis and patient risk management could be assisted. AIMS: This study investigated the role of child abuse and ongoing emotional impact from abuse on the risk of suicidality during the first week of treatment with an antidepressant. The patient sample for this study was drawn from one site of a larger pharmacogenetic study. The hypothesis was that subjects with high impact child abuse would have greater elevation of suicidality during the first week of antidepressant treatment. METHODS: Fifty-one subjects were initiated on either venlafaxine (VEN) or escitalopram (ESC) for major depressive disorder (MDD) and had pre-treatment suicidality assayed with the reasons for living scale (RFLS), which was repeated after one week of treatment. Several clinical, demographic and genotype variables were controlled for. The 15-item Impact of Event Scale (IES-15) was administered to subjects reporting abuse to dichotomise the abuse group into low and high (IES-15 ≥ 26) impact groups for sub-analysis as per the scales validated rating guidelines. RESULTS: Subjects reporting no child abuse exposure were less likely to have increased suicidality during the first week of antidepressant treatment (7.6%) compared to subjects with low impact abuse (38.5%, p = 0.041) and high impact abuse (58.3%, p = 0.009). Only high impact abuse predicted increased suicidality after adjustment for potential confounders such as depression severity (OR = 31.5, 95% CI = 1.3 to 748.7, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: If these findings are replicated in larger samples, child abuse history could become an important element of assessing risk benefit balance when initiating antidepressants and may help guide the level of patient review needed during antidepressant initiation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1177/0004867413510212,"Adult;Adult Survivors of Child Abuse/*psychology;Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use;Citalopram/*therapeutic use;Cyclohexanols/*therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/psychology;Female;Humans;Male;Risk Factors;Suicidal Ideation;Suicide, Attempted/*psychology;Venlafaxine Hydrochloride;Suicide;Only Child;Child;Antidepressive Agents",24280998,

METHODS: COMT Val158met polymorphism was genotyped in 334 Chinese major depressive disorder (MDD) patients who were treated with fluoxetine for at least 4 weeks. Clinical response was evaluated using the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(21)). In the analysis of association, response was defined as >or=50% decrease in HAM-D(21) score after treatment and then further clarified by intra-individual changes in HAM-D(21) score.

Citalopram was administered for 4 weeks to the 71 patients who completed this study. We found significant differences in genotype, allele, and carrier distribution between the normal group and MDD patients (genotypes: chi(2) = 6.473, d.f. = 2, p = 0.039; alleles: chi(2) = 5.589, d.f. = 1, p = 0.018; OR = 0.618, 95% CI = 0.414-0.922; allele carriers: chi(2) = 5.383, d.f. = 1, p = 0.020; OR = 0.473, 95% CI = 0.249-0.879).

METHOD: From 2009 to 2012, bipolar depressed patients, confirmed by DSM-IV-TR-structured interview, were screened for AIM. An AIM+ case was defined as a manic/hypomanic episode within 60 days of starting or changing dose of antidepressant, while an AIM- control was defined as an adequate (≥ 60 days) exposure to an antidepressant with no associated manic/hypomanic episode. 591 subjects (205 AIM+ and 386 AIM-) exposed to an antidepressant and a subset of 545 subjects (191 AIM+ and 354 AIM-) treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) were used to evaluate the association of AIM with phenotypic clinical risk factors previously published. 295 white subjects (113 AIM+ cases, 182 AIM-controls) were genotyped for 3 SLC6A4 variants: the 5-HTTLPR, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs25531, and the intron 2 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). Tests of association with AIM were performed for each polymorphism and the haplotype. RESULTS: The only clinical risk factors associated with AIM in the overall and the SSRI + SNRI analysis was bipolar I subtype. The S allele of 5-HTTLPR was not significantly associated with AIM; however, a meta-analysis combining this sample with 5 prior studies provided marginal evidence of association (P = .059). The L-A-10 haplotype was associated with a reduced risk of AIM (P = .012). DISCUSSION: Narrowly defined, AIM appears to be at greatest risk for bipolar I patients. Our haplotype analysis of SLC6A4 suggests that future pharmacogenetic studies should not only focus on the SLC6A4 promotor variation but also investigate the role of other variants in the gene.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.4088/JCP.14m09127,Adult;Bipolar Disorder/*chemically induced/*genetics;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Genetic Variation/*genetics;Humans;Male;Risk Factors;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use;Bipolar Disorder;Antidepressive Agents,25611077,

The anticholinergic agent scopolamine has also shown promise as a rapid-acting antidepressant. This study applied genome-wide markers to investigate the role of genetic variants in predicting acute antidepressant response to both agents. The ketamine-treated sample included 157 unrelated European subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). The scopolamine-treated sample comprised 37 unrelated European subjects diagnosed with either MDD or BD who had a current Major Depressive Episode (MDE), and had failed at least two adequate treatment trials for depression. Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scale scores at day 1 (24 h post-treatment) was considered the primary outcome. Here, we conduct pilot genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses to identify potential markers of ketamine response and dissociative side effects. Polygenic risk score analysis of SNPs ranked by the strength of their association with ketamine response was then calculated in order to assess whether common genetic markers from the ketamine study could predict response to scopolamine. Findings require replication in larger samples in light of low power of analyses of these small samples. Neverthless, these data provide a promising illustration of our future potential to identify genetic variants underlying rapid treatment response in mood disorders and may ultimately guide individual patient treatment selection in the future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41398-018-0311-7,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Ketamine/*therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;Multifactorial Inheritance;*Pharmacogenomic Testing;Pilot Projects;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Risk Factors;Scopolamine/*therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Genome;Ketamine;Genomics",30552317,PMC6294748

A functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene SLC6A4 has been shown to modulate SLC6A4 transcription, affecting response to SSRIs. Several studies in populations of predominantly European ancestry have consistently found that the SLC6A4 promoter polymorphism (referred to as the 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region; 5-HTTLPR) long (L) allele is associated with better response to SSRI treatment than the short (S) allele. OBJECTIVE: The frequency of SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR) alleles in 865 black Americans and Afro-Caribbeans was examined to assess possible implications for treatment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR) genotypes were determined in individuals with self-identified African ancestry from South Carolina (n = 489), western Pennsylvania (n = 207), and Tobago (n = 169). Frequencies were compared using chi-square analyses. RESULTS: It was verified that the L allele is highly prevalent in Americans of African ancestry, ranging from 77% in western Pennsylvania to 87% in South Carolina. The frequency of the SLC6A4-(L) allele is significantly higher in African-Americans than has been reported for European-Americans (typically 56-60%). There are both statistically significant geographic differences and slight deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Both MDD pathogenesis and antidepressant effect are supposed to be strongly affected by genetic polymorphisms. Among promising candidate genes, distrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), translin-associated factor X (TSNAX) and D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA) were suggested since their regulator role in neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity and neurotransmission, and previous evidence of cross-involvement in major psychiatric diseases. METHODS: The present paper investigated the role of 13 SNPs within the reported genes in MDD susceptibility through a case-control (n=320 and n=150, respectively) study and in citalopram efficacy (n=157). Measures of citalopram efficacy were response (4th week) and remission (12th week). Pharmacogenetic findings were tested in the STAR(⁎)D genome-wide dataset (n=1892) for replication. RESULTS: Evidence of association among rs3738401 (DISC1), rs1615409 and rs766288 (TSNAX) and MDD was found (p=0.004, p=0.0019, and p=0.008, respectively).

DESIGN: Secondary analyses of baseline data collected in a single-arm study of pharmacogenetic predictors of acamprosate response. SETTING: Academic medical center and affiliated community-based treatment programs in the American upper mid-west. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 287 males and 156 females aged 18-80 years, meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was 'propensity to drink in negative emotional situations' (determined by the Inventory of Drug Taking Situations) and the key predictors/covariates were sex and psychiatric comorbidities, including MDD, SID, AnxD and SIA (determined by Psychiatric Research Interview of Substance and Mood Disorders). FINDINGS: The prevalence of the MDD, SID and AnxD was higher in females compared with males (33.1 versus 18.4%, 44.8 versus 26.4% and 42.2 versus 27.4%, respectively; P < 0.01, each), while SIA was rare (3.3%) and did not differ by sex. Increased propensity to drink in negative emotional situations was associated with comorbid MDD (β = 6.6, P = 0.013) and AnxD (β = 4.8, P = 0.042) as well as a SID × sex interaction effect (P = 0.003), indicating that the association of SID with propensity to drink in negative emotional situations differs by sex and is stronger in males (β = 7.9, P = 0.009) compared with females (β = -6.6, P = 0.091).

Chronic therapy with standard antidepressant drugs, such as imipramine, can downregulate HPA axis function, indicating that the HPA axis may be an important target for antidepressant action. We tested several doses of a standardized commercial preparation of Hypericum perforatum plant extract (popularly known as St. John's Wort), a medicinal herb used for treating mild depressive symptoms, to determine whether it also modulated HPA axis function. Chronic imipramine treatment (daily injections for 8 weeks) of male Sprague-Dawley rats significantly downregulated circulating plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone compared to animals treated with saline. However, chronic St. John's Wort treatment (daily gavage for 8 weeks) had no effect on plasma ACTH or corticosterone, even at the highest doses tested. Our results confirm previous findings that imipramine may have significant peripheral HPA axis-mediated effects. However, our data does not support any role for H. perforatum in modulation of HPA axis function, suggesting that alternative pathways may be involved in mediating its antidepressant effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1055/s-2003-43507,"Adrenal Glands/*drug effects/physiology;Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood;Animals;Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology;Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/pharmacology;Corticosterone/blood;Hypericum/*chemistry;Hypothalamus/*drug effects/physiology;Imipramine/*pharmacology;Male;Pituitary Gland/*drug effects/physiology;Plant Extracts/pharmacology;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Hypericum;Antidepressive Agents;Imipramine",14605995,

Significant association (gene-wide correction) was observed for remission following treatment with bupropion for a SNP within the serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A rs2770296, p(corrected)=0.02). Response to bupropion treatment was significantly associated with a SNP in the dopamine transporter gene (rs6347, p(corrected)=0.013).

The aim of the present genome-wide association study was to identify additional genetic variants involved in increasing suicidal ideation during escitalopram and nortriptyline treatment. A total of 706 adult participants of European ancestry, treated for major depression with escitalopram or nortriptyline over 12 weeks in the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study were genotyped with Illumina Human 610-Quad Beadchips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 244 subjects experienced an increase in suicidal ideation during follow-up. The genetic marker most significantly associated with increasing suicidality (8.28 × 10(-7)) was a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs11143230) located 30 kb downstream of a gene encoding guanine deaminase (GDA) on chromosome 9q21.13. Two suggestive drug-specific associations within KCNIP4 (Kv channel-interacting protein 4; chromosome 4p15.31) and near ELP3 (elongation protein 3 homolog; chromosome 8p21.1) were found in subjects treated with escitalopram. Suggestive drug by gene interactions for two SNPs near structural variants on chromosome 4q12, one SNP in the apolipoprotein O (APOO) gene on chromosome Xp22.11 and one on chromosome 11q24.3 were found. The most significant association within a set of 33 candidate genes was in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) gene. Finally, we also found trend for an association within genes previously associated with psychiatric phenotypes indirectly linked to suicidal behavior, that is, GRIP1, NXPH1 and ANK3. The results suggest novel pathways involved in increasing suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment and should help to target treatment to reduce the risk of this dramatic adverse event.

Responders outperformed nonresponders across all cognitive domains, with the largest differences observed in executive, language and working memory functions. Results indicate poorer global cognitive functioning is predictive of treatment nonresponse. Deficits were most pronounced in tests demanding greater mental search and manipulation rather than speeded motor output.

Based on pharmacogenomics, we examined whether plasma concentration of risperidone is associated with clinical response and adverse side-effects. METHODS: We recruited patients with chronic schizophrenia who were then treated with risperidone. The CYP2D6 genotypes were determined using targeted sequencing. All high-frequency mutation sites of the nine exons of the gene were assayed in the present study. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-RIS) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Psychiatric symptoms were monitored using The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Adverse effects were evaluated using the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Follow-up visits were scheduled at weeks 2,4, and 8 after treatment initiation. RESULTS: Among the 76 patients, 100 C > T (rs1065852), 1038 C > T (rs1081003), 1662 G > C (rs1058164), 2851 C > T (rs16947), and 4181G > C (rs1135840) variants were detected. The most common allele was CYP2D6*10 (81.6%), whereas CYP2D6*2 (9.2%) and CYP2D6*5 (17.1%) were relatively rare. Plasma levels of risperidone and the risperidone/9-OH risperidone ratio (R/9-OH) were significantly increased in individuals with CYP2D6*10 (P < 0.05). The change in PANSS score, weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, prolactin (PRL) level, and ESRS were significantly different from baseline, between the different genotypes (P < 0.01). Moreover, individuals with CYP2D6*10 homozygous (TT) mutations were associated with higher risperidone concentration and R/9-OH ratio than those with heterozygous mutations (CT) (P < 0.01). A change from baseline in BPRS scores was observed only during week 8 and was different between heterozygous and homozygous mutations. As for the C2851T polymorphism, the incidence of adverse metabolic effects was significantly different between the C/C and C/T genotypes (P < 0.01). Regarding the G4181C polymorphisms, the changes from baseline in GLU and TG, were different between the C/C and C/G genotypes (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The genotype of CYP2D6 significantly influences the plasma concentration of risperidone and may subsequently influence the adverse side-effects following risperidone treatment, while also exerting a slight influence on clinical outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12888-020-03034-9,"*Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/genetics;Humans;Isoxazoles;Paliperidone Palmitate;Plasma;Pyrimidines;*Risperidone/therapeutic use;Risperidone;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6;Polymorphism, Genetic",33535976,PMC7856706

METHODS: This randomized, open-label, pharmacologic trial was conducted among patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) in 32 hospitals across China. Patients were randomly assigned to 7 groups and assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess changes of metabolic measures over time. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the risk factors for MetS. RESULTS: In total, 2,550 (718 drug-naïve) of 2,774 patients finished the study between July 6, 2010, and November 30, 2011. We found significant (P < .05) changes for BMI, WC, TG, and LDL-C, with TG and LDL-C reaching a plateau. Interactions between baseline metabolic condition and changes over time were observed for BMI (χ² = 43.11, P < .001), WC (χ² = 36.34, P < .001), systolic BP (χ² = 11.92, P = .002), glucose (χ² = 6.09, P = .01), and TG (χ² = 6.01, P = .01). Antipsychotics generally had greater adverse effects on patients who were initially screened as metabolically normal. After controlling for other associated factors, we found that antipsychotics resulted in differing risk for incident MetS, with a similar pattern to findings in other populations: olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] = 3.36, P < .001) > quetiapine (OR = 3.29, P < .001) > perphenazine (OR = 2.73, P = .007) > risperidone (OR = 2.21, P = .02) > aripiprazole (OR = 1.74, P = .15) ≈ haloperidol (OR = 1.75, P = .22) ≈ ziprasidone (OR = 1, reference). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic traits should be monitored frequently in early stages of antipsychotic treatment due to rapid and substantial changes.

In this study, we attempted to evaluate the degree of the impact of different CYP2D6 genotypes on the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of paroxetine in a Japanese population using a population PK approach. METHODS: This retrospective study included 179 Japanese patients with major depressive disorder who were being treated with paroxetine. CYP2D6*1, *2, *5, *10, and *41 polymorphisms were observed. A total of 306 steady-state concentrations for paroxetine were collected from the patients. A nonlinear mixed-effects model identified the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of paroxetine; the covariates included CYP2D6 genotypes, patient age, body weight, sex, and daily paroxetine dose. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of CYP2D6*1, *2, *5, *10, and *41 were 39.4, 14.5, 4.5, 41.1, and 0.6%, respectively. There was no poor metabolizer who had two nonfunctional CYP2D6*5 alleles. A one-compartment model showed that the apparent Km value was decreased by 20.6% in patients with the CYP2D6*10/*10 genotype in comparison with the other CYP2D6 genotypes.

CONCLUSION: Unexpectedly, elimination was accelerated in individuals with the CYP2D6*10/*10 genotype. Our results show that the presence of one CYP2D6*5 allele or that of any CYP2D6*10 allele may have no major effect on paroxetine PKs in the steady state.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1097/FPC.0000000000000228,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Asians/genetics;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Female;Gene Frequency;Humans;Japan;Male;Middle Aged;Paroxetine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Pharmacogenomic Variants;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Retrospective Studies;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Young Adult;Depressive Disorder;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Genotype;Depressive Disorder, Major;Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6",27187662,
Visualizing Patterns of Medication Switching Among Major Depressive Patients with Various Stability and Difficulty to Treatments.,2021,,,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,1176-6328 (Print),17,,1953-1963,Hung YC and Chen HC and Kuo PH and Lu ML and Huang MC and Chen CH and Wang S and Mao WC and Wu CS and Wu TH,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34168454/,eng,,,"INTRODUCTION: Efforts have been made in assessing efficacy and tolerability to various antidepressants, but understanding personalized chances of stability to medication switching sequence is still inconclusive. This study aimed to identify naturalistic switching patterns of medication in stratifying MDD patients. METHODS: MDD patients were stratified based on treatment difficulty evaluated with the ""Treatment Resistance to Antidepressants Evaluation Scale for Unipolar Depression"" (TRADES). The duration of the time of diagnoses until the final switch to another class of antidepressants was used as prediction of unstable to drug therapy. ROC analysis was used to determine the cutoff values. A continuous temporal events function from the visual analytic tool was employed to perform patterns of switching between distinct pharmacological class such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). RESULTS: TRADES scores of 4.5 and not-switching times of 12.5 months were used as cutoff values to divide patients into four subgroups: stable/easy-to-treat (SE), unstable/easy-to-treat (UE), stable/difficult-to-treat (SD) and unstable/difficult-to-treat (UD). A total of 80% and 76.9% of patients initially treated with the SSRIs paroxetine or fluoxetine, respectively, were predicted to be stable to drug therapy. Approximately 70%, 44.8% and 41.4% of patients initially treated with the SNRIs fluvoxamine, sertraline and venlafaxine, respectively, were predicted to be UD, and 60% of patients using duloxetine were predicted to be stable to drug therapy. Analysis of the switching phenomenon showed that SSRIs were the first prescribed medications and mostly taken by the stable subgroups, and SNRIs were the preferentially chosen switching alternative. Medication switching patterns in unstable MDD patients are discussed. CONCLUSION: Paroxetine, fluoxetine and duloxetine users were mostly stable among MDD patients in Taiwan with various stability and difficulty to treatments. Although responsiveness to specific medication sequence is likely required for clinical application, the results provide a baseline for such studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.2147/NDT.S311429,,34168454,PMC8217841

The present study was carried out to determine the association between genotypes of HTR1A-rs6295 and HTR2A-rs6311 with SSRI treatment outcome among the ethnic Malay patients diagnosed with first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD). The patients were recruited from four tertiary hospitals in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. Predefined efficacy phenotypes based on 25% (partial early response) and 50% (clinical efficacy response) reduction in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale-self Rated score (MADRS-S) were adopted for assessment of treatment efficacy in this study. Self-reporting for adverse effects (AE) was documented using the Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effect (PRISE) after treatment with SSRI for up to 6 weeks. Adjusted binary logistic regression between genotypes of the polymorphism obtained using sequencing technique with the treatment outcome phenotypes was performed. The 142 patients recruited were made up of 96 females (67.6%) and 46 males (32.4%). Clinical efficacy and Partial early response phenotypes were not significantly associated with genotypes of HTR1A and HTR2A polymorphism. The GG genotype of HTR2A polymorphism has decreased odds for dizziness (CNS) and increased odds for poor concentration. The GA genotype increases the odd for excessive sweating, diarrhoea, constipation and blurred vision. The CC genotype of HTR1A-rs6295 decreases the odd for nausea/vomiting and increases the odd for anxiety.

This retrospective study examined whether plasma acylcarnitine profiles can help biochemically distinguish the three phenotypic subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD): core depression (CD+), anxious depression (ANX+), and neurovegetative symptoms of melancholia (NVSM+). METHODS: Depressed outpatients (n = 240) from the Mayo Clinic Pharmacogenomics Research Network were treated with citalopram or escitalopram for eight weeks. Plasma samples collected at baseline and after eight weeks of treatment with citalopram or escitalopram were profiled for short-, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitine levels using AbsoluteIDQ®p180-Kit and LC-MS. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine whether acylcarnitine levels discriminated the clinical phenotypes at baseline or eight weeks post-treatment, and whether temporal changes in acylcarnitine profiles differed between groups. RESULTS: Compared to ANX+, CD+ and NVSM+ had significantly lower concentrations of short- and long-chain acylcarnitines at both baseline and week 8. In NVSM+, the medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were also significantly lower in NVSM+ compared to ANX+. Short-chain acylcarnitine levels increased significantly from baseline to week 8 in CD+ and ANX+, whereas medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines significantly decreased in CD+ and NVSM+. CONCLUSIONS: In depressed patients treated with SSRIs, β-oxidation and mitochondrial energetics as evaluated by levels and changes in acylcarnitines may provide the biochemical basis of the clinical heterogeneity of MDD, especially when combined with clinical characteristics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.122,"Carnitine/analogs & derivatives;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy;Humans;Phenotype;Retrospective Studies",32056779,PMC7024064

Although the posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex (pVMPFC) and its functional connections have been consistently implicated in MDD, their roles in anhedonia remain poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unknown whether anhedonia is primarily associated with intrinsic 'resting-state' pVMPFC functional connectivity or an inability to modulate connectivity in a context-specific manner. To address these gaps, a pVMPFC region of interest was first identified using activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. pVMPFC connectivity was then examined in relation to anhedonia and general distress symptoms of depression, using both resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging involving pleasant music, in current MDD and healthy control groups. In MDD, pVMPFC connectivity was negatively correlated with anhedonia but not general distress during music listening in key reward- and emotion-processing regions, including nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra, orbitofrontal cortex and insula, as well as fronto-temporal regions involved in tracking complex sound sequences, including middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. No such dissociations were observed in the healthy controls, and resting-state pVMPFC connectivity did not dissociate anhedonia from general distress in either group. Our findings demonstrate that anhedonia in MDD is associated with context-specific deficits in pVMPFC connectivity with the mesolimbic reward system when encountering pleasurable stimuli, rather than a static deficit in intrinsic resting-state connectivity. Critically, identification of functional circuits associated with anhedonia better characterizes MDD heterogeneity and may help track of one of its core symptoms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/tp.2016.80,"Adult;*Anhedonia;Brain/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Case-Control Studies;Cerebral Cortex/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*psychology;Female;Functional Neuroimaging;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neural Pathways/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Nucleus Accumbens/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Prefrontal Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology;Reward;Stress, Psychological/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*psychology;Substantia Nigra/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Temporal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Ventral Tegmental Area/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Heart Block;Prefrontal Cortex",27187232,PMC5070048

Despite its efficacy, however, 30% to 40% of patients do not respond to treatment. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether clinical improvement or adverse events are related to the corrected dose of FLX at 8 and 12 weeks after starting treatment in a sample of adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS: Seventy-four subjects aged between 10 and 17 years participated in the study. Clinical improvement was measured with the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale, whereas the UKU (Udvalg for Klinske Undersogelser) scale was administered to assess adverse effects of treatment. RESULTS: Fluoxetine per kilograms of body weight was related to serum concentration of FLX, NORFLX (norfluoxetine), FLX + NORFLX, and FLX/NORFLX. No relationship was found between dose-corrected FLX levels and therapeutic or adverse effects. No differences in serum concentrations were found between responders and nonresponders to treatment. Sex differences were observed in relation to dose and FLX serum concentration. The analysis by diagnosis revealed differences in FLX dose between obsessive-compulsive disorder patients and both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine response seems to be influenced by factors such as sex, diagnosis, or certain genes that might be involved in the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Lamotrigine improved depression, but its effectiveness was reduced by FA. We investigated the baseline predictors and correlates of clinical response, and the possible basis of the interaction. METHODS: The main outcome was change in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks, measured using the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms-self report version 16 (QIDS-SR16). We examined the relationship between symptoms and lamotrigine levels, and biochemical measures of one-carbon metabolism and functional polymorphisms in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1). RESULTS: Lamotrigine levels were unaffected by FA and did not differ between those participants who achieved remission and those with persisting symptoms. When participants with subtherapeutic serum levels were excluded, there was a main effect of lamotrigine on the main outcome, although this remained limited to those randomized to FA placebo. None of the biochemical measures correlated with clinical outcome. The negative impact of FA on lamotrigine response was limited to COMT Met carriers. FOLH1 and MTHFR had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clarify that FA's inhibition of lamotrigine's efficacy is not a pharmacokinetic effect, and that low serum lamotrigine levels contributed to lamotrigine's lack of a main effect at 12 weeks. We were unable to explain the lamotrigine-FA interaction, but our finding that it is modulated by the COMT genotype provides a starting point for follow-on neurobiological investigations. More broadly, our results highlight the value of including biochemical and genetic indices in randomized clinical trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1111/bdi.12531,Adult;*Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics;Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/*genetics;Double-Blind Method;Drug Combinations;Female;*Folic Acid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Humans;Lamotrigine;Male;Pharmacogenomic Testing;Psychotropic Drugs/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;*Quetiapine Fumarate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Treatment Outcome;*Triazines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Bipolar Disorder;Folic Acid;Molecular Biology,28833962,PMC5697684

This clinical presentation, chronic and highly disabling, is known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The causes of treatment resistance and their relationships with causes underlying schizophrenia are largely unknown. Adequately powered genetic studies of TRS are scarce because of the difficulty in collecting data from well-characterized TRS cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the genetic architecture of TRS through the reassessment of genetic data from schizophrenia studies and its validation in carefully ascertained clinical samples. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two case-control genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia were performed in which the case samples were defined as individuals with TRS (n = 10 501) and individuals with non-TRS (n = 20 325). The differences in effect sizes for allelic associations were then determined between both studies, the reasoning being such differences reflect treatment resistance instead of schizophrenia. Genotype data were retrieved from the CLOZUK and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia studies. The output was validated using polygenic risk score (PRS) profiling of 2 independent schizophrenia cohorts with TRS and non-TRS: a prevalence sample with 817 individuals (Cardiff Cognition in Schizophrenia [CardiffCOGS]) and an incidence sample with 563 individuals (Genetics Workstream of the Schizophrenia Treatment Resistance and Therapeutic Advances [STRATA-G]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: GWAS of treatment resistance in schizophrenia. The results of the GWAS were compared with complex polygenic traits through a genetic correlation approach and were used for PRS analysis on the independent validation cohorts using the same TRS definition. RESULTS: The study included a total of 85 490 participants (48 635 [56.9%] male) in its GWAS stage and 1380 participants (859 [62.2%] male) in its PRS validation stage. Treatment resistance in schizophrenia emerged as a polygenic trait with detectable heritability (1% to 4%), and several traits related to intelligence and cognition were found to be genetically correlated with it (genetic correlation, 0.41-0.69). PRS analysis in the CardiffCOGS prevalence sample showed a positive association between TRS and a history of taking clozapine (r2 = 2.03%; P = .001), which was replicated in the STRATA-G incidence sample (r2 = 1.09%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this GWAS, common genetic variants were differentially associated with TRS, and these associations may have been obscured through the amalgamation of large GWAS samples in previous studies of broadly defined schizophrenia. Findings of this study suggest the validity of meta-analytic approaches for studies on patient outcomes, including treatment resistance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.3799,Female;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Male;Multifactorial Inheritance/genetics;*Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy;*Schizophrenia/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics;Schizophrenia,35019943,PMC8756361

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An SSRI and NRI response (defined as > or =50% decrease in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score at 6 weeks). RESULTS: NRI response was associated with the NET G1287A polymorphism (odds ratio [OR], 7.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.53-22.49; P<.001). An SSRI response was associated with the 5-HTT intron 2 s/l variation (OR, 20.11; 95% CI, 4.27-94.74; P<.001). The 5-HTTLPR was also associated with an SSRI response (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.41-7.91; P = .006). In contrast to studies in white patients, the favorable allele for SSRI response was S 5-HTTLPR. The S 5-HTTLPR was associated also with NRI response (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 1.32-10.53; P = .01). The NET polymorphism was not associated with an SSRI response. The NET G1287A GG genotype (56% of the population) was associated with better response to the NRI (83.3% [35/42]) than to SSRI (58.7% [44/75]) (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.39-8.95; P = .006). Some genotype combinations were associated with high rates of antidepressant response and others with low rates of response. CONCLUSIONS: Monoamine transporter gene polymorphisms were associated with response to antidepressants with homologous monoamine transporter targets. Combinations of polymorphisms were informative for response and nonresponse. Confirmation of these preliminary findings would permit refined pharmacogenetic selection of antidepressant treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1001/jama.296.13.1609,"Adult;Aged;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;Asians/*genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics;Female;Fluoxetine/therapeutic use;Humans;Korea;Male;Middle Aged;Norepinephrine/antagonists & inhibitors;Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;Nortriptyline/therapeutic use;Polymorphism, Genetic;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use;Sertraline/therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents",17018806,

Our study aimed to identify predictors of acute antidepressant efficacy in patients with first-episode Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). METHODS: 187 patients with first-episode MDD were included and assessed clinical symptoms, cognitive function and global functioning using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAMD-17), MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Participants received treatment with a SSRI (escitalopram or venlafaxine) for 4 weeks. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between patients' characteristics, symptom profiles, cognitive performance, and global functioning and the antidepressant outcome at the end of 4 weeks, and ROC curve analysis was performed for predictive accuracy with area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: Antidepressant improvement, response and remission rate at week 4 was 87.7%, 64.7% and 42.8%, respectively. The combination of pretreatment clinical profiles, speed of processing and global functioning showed moderate discrimination of acute improvement, response and remission with AUCs of 0.863, 0.812 and 0.734, respectively. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of the present study is the study did not combine pharmacogenomics from the perspective of antidepressant drug metabolism. CONCLUSION: Aside from the baseline clinical symptoms, cognitive function and global functioning could be predictors of acute treatment outcome in first episode MDD using escitalopram or venlafaxine. This relatively simple application based on clinical symptoms and function seems to be cost-effective method to identify individuals who are more likely to respond to antidepressant treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pharmacogenomic testing",10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.029,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;*Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/drug therapy/psychology;Escitalopram;Humans;ROC Curve;Treatment Outcome;Venlafaxine Hydrochloride/therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major;Depressive Disorder;Antidepressive Agents",35172174,

Combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy show increased efficacy but higher cost compared with antidepressant pharmacotherapy; baseline predictors of pharmacotherapy resistance could be used to identify patients more likely to benefit from combined treatment. METHODS: We performed a proof-of-principle study of the cost-effectiveness of using previously identified pharmacogenetic and clinical risk factors (PGx-CL-R) of antidepressant resistance or clinical risk factors alone (CL-R) to guide the prescription of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy vs pharmacotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of these two strategies was compared with standard care (ST, pharmacotherapy to all subjects) using a three-year Markov model. Model parameters were literature-based estimates of response to pharmacotherapy and combined treatment, costs (UK National Health System) and benefits (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], one QALY=one year lived in perfect health). RESULTS: CL-R was more cost-effective than PGx-CL-R: the cost of one-QALY improvement was £2341 for CL-R and £3937 for PGx-CL-R compared to ST. PGx-CL-R had similar or better cost-effectiveness compared to CL-R when 1) the cost of genotyping was £100 per subject or less or 2) the PGx-CL-R test had sensitivity ≥ 0.90 and specificity ≥ 0.85. The cost of one-QALY improvement for CL-R was £3664 and of £4110 in two independent samples. LIMITATIONS: lack of validation in large samples from the general population.

Preliminary study of structural magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes related to genetic variation in Interleukin-1β rs16944 in adolescents with Bipolar Disorder.,2020,3,,Journal of psychiatric research,1879-1379 (Electronic),122,,33-41,Shonibare DO and Patel R and Islam AH and Metcalfe AWS and Fiksenbaum L and Kennedy JL and Freeman N and MacIntosh BJ and Goldstein BI,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31918351/,eng,,England,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD), among the most heritable psychiatric conditions, is associated with increased pro-inflammatory blood markers and pro-inflammatory gene expression in post-mortem brain. We therefore examined the effects of pro-inflammatory single nucleotide polymorphism interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rs16944 on brain structure in adolescents with BD and healthy control (HC) adolescents. METHODS: T(1)-weighted 3-T magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired for 38 adolescents with BD and 32 HC adolescents (14-20 years). Using FreeSurfer, a priori regions of interest analyses, examining hippocampus, amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and caudal anterior cingulate cortex, were complemented by exploratory whole-brain vertex-wise analyses. General linear models assessed the association between IL-1β rs16944 and the ROIs, controlling for sex, age, and intracranial volume. RESULTS: There was an IL-1β rs16944 polymorphism-by-diagnosis interaction effect on the DLPFC; T-carriers with BD had greater surface area compared to non-carriers with BD. Whereas, HC T-carriers had smaller DLPFC volume compared to HC non-carriers. In vertex-wise analyses, similar interactions were evident in a pars triangularis surface area cluster and a lateral occipital cortex volume cluster. Whole-brain analyses also yielded a main effect of IL-1β rs16944 polymorphism, whereby T-carriers had greater lateral occipital cortex surface area and volume. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-1β rs16944 polymorphism is associated with neurostructural phenotypes in cognitive and visual regions that subserve functions, including facial recognition and response inhibition, which are known to be aberrant in BD. Future studies are warranted to evaluate whether the observed rs16944-related structural differences are relevant to neurocognitive function, functional neuroimaging phenotypes and IL-1β protein levels.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.12.018,Adolescent;*Bipolar Disorder/diagnostic imaging/genetics;Brain/diagnostic imaging;Humans;*Interleukin-1beta/genetics;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phenotype;Prefrontal Cortex;Bipolar Disorder;Genetic Variation,31918351,

Investigating the potential role of BDNF and PRL genotypes on antidepressant response in depression patients: A prospective inception cohort study in treatment-free patients.,2019,12,1,Journal of affective disorders,1573-2517 (Electronic),259,,432-439,Ochi T and Vyalova NM and Losenkov IS and Levchuk LA and Osmanova DZ and Mikhalitskaya EV and Loonen AJM and Bosker FJ and Simutkin GG and Bokhan NA and Wilffert B and Ivanova SA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31611000/,eng,,Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with response to antidepressant drugs in mood and anxiety disorders. Prolactin (PRL) is a pituitary hormone with behavioural effects, acting as a neurotrophic factor within the brain and may be involved in antidepressant response. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between BDNF and PRL genotypes with antidepressant drug response. METHODS: Prospective inception cohort of 186 Russian treatment-free participants (28 men and 158 women) between 18 and 70 years clinically diagnosed with depressive disorder who initiated antidepressant medication. DNA polymorphisms were genotyped for PRL rs1341239, BDNF rs6265 and rs7124442. Primary outcome was measured by differences in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (∆HAM-D) scores between baseline/week two, week two/week four, and baseline/week four. Linear regression and independent t-test determined the significance between polymorphisms and ∆HAM-D. RESULTS: Comparisons between genotypes did not reveal any significant differences in scores during the first two weeks of treatment. In the latter two weeks, BDNF rs7124442 homozygous C patients responded significantly worse in comparison to homozygous T patients during this period. Further analysis within women and in post-menopausal women found a similar comparison between alleles. LIMITATIONS: Study lasted four weeks, which may be considered short to associate genuine antidepressant effects. CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking tricylic antidepressants were noted to have a significant improvement in ∆HAM-D compared to patients taking SSRIs.

Previous shreds of evidence have indicated that genetics, cognitive, neuroendocrine, as well as personality factors, are all intrinsically linked and contribute to the diversity of treatment outcomes. We, therefore, sought to investigate this hypothesis in this study. METHOD: Based on 610 samples treated with a selection of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) or tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), we compared the therapeutic effects of these four classes of drugs by survival analyses. Pharmacogenomic and survival analyses were carried out to explore the hereditary factors for curative effect and the accumulation of genetic factors was further discussed through pathway analysis and the global test. We built a machine learning-based prediction model that integrates genetic and non-genetic factors (including cognition, endocrinology, personality intelligence) to distinguish drug efficacy in single class drug situations. The values of the non-genetic makers after 6 weeks' treatment were collected to evaluate the efficacy of the model. RESULTS: Our results from the 6-week antidepressant therapeutic study indicated that SSRI and SNRI are better treatments than those of TCA and NaSSA in the Chinese population. Among all possible paired single-agent survival analyses, citalopram and venlafaxine were more effective than mirtazapine. Allele C carriers at rs6354 (SLC6A4) and allele G carriers at rs12150214 (SLC6A4) were significantly prone to poorer treatment response to fluoxetine. Besides, the combination of three loci (rs929377-rs6191-rs32897) located in HPA pathway was significantly associated with the treatment outcome of fluoxetine. In female MDD patients, the minor allele of rs6323 and rs1137070 on the MAOA gene likely lead to a worse response to venlafaxine. Furthermore, genetic variants linked to drug efficacy tended to concentrate on the neurotrophin pathway in depressed patients comorbid with anxiety. From multivariate models, more severe cognitive deficits, psychopathic personality and lower levels of operational intelligence, and higher levels of cortisol predicted worse response status with SSRI or SNRI after 6-week treatment. Notably, genetic factors in the multi-dimensional prediction model for both classes of drugs include loci in HTR2A and CRHBP genes. CONCLUSION: SSRI and SNRI are more suitable for the treatment of Chinese people with depression. SLC6A4 genetic variants, as well as HPA pathway, play an important role in the fluoxetine antidepressant therapeutic response while the polymorphism of MAOA gene involved in the pharmacological action of venlafaxine among female MDD patients. The presence of anxiety in MDD patients was related to the neurotrophin pathway. Genetic, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and personality intelligence factors combined have an ensemble impact on the medication effect of patients with major depression, leading to more precise and personalized medicine for specific groups of people.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110036,"Adult;Alleles;Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use;China;Cognition/*physiology;Depressive Disorder, Major/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/psychology;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monoamine Oxidase/genetics;Neuropsychological Tests;Personality/*physiology;Prognosis;Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Treatment Outcome;Young Adult;Antidepressive Agents",32702381,
Co-Variation of Peripheral Levels of miR-1202 and Brain Activity and Connectivity During Antidepressant Treatment.,2017,9,,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of           Neuropsychopharmacology,1740-634X (Electronic),42,10,2043-2051,Lopez JP and Pereira F and Richard-Devantoy S and Berlim M and Chachamovich E and Fiori LM and Niola P and Turecki G and Jollant F,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28079059/,eng,,,"MicroRNAs are short non-coding molecules that play a major role in regulating gene expression. Peripheral levels of miR-1202 have been shown to predict and mediate antidepressant response. However, it is not clear to what extent these peripheral measures reflect central neural changes in vivo. We approached this problem with the combined use of peripheral miR-1202 measures and neuroimaging. At baseline and after 8 weeks of desvenlafaxine (50-100 mg die), 20 patients were scanned with 3T magnetic resonance imaging, first at rest then during the Go/NoGo task, a classical test of response inhibition. Blood samples were collected at both time points. During resting state, lower baseline miR-1202 levels were predictive of increased connectivity from T0 to T8 between the posterior cingulate and the prefrontal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Changes in miR-1202 levels following desvenlafaxine treatment were negatively correlated with changes in activity in right precuneus within the default-mode network, and in connectivity between the posterior cingulate and the temporal and prefrontal cortices, and the precuneus. During the Go/NoGo task, baseline miR-1202 levels and changes in these levels were correlated with activity changes in different regions, including bilateral prefrontal, insular, cingulate, and temporal cortices, and left putamen and claustrum. Finally, secondary analyses in a subset of patients showed a trend for a significant correlation between miR-1202 levels and glutamate levels measured by spectroscopy. Changes in peripheral miR-1202 levels were therefore associated with changes in brain activity and connectivity in a network of brain regions associated with depression and antidepressant response.

The genes encoding the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT1) transporters are among the possible candidate genes modulating an individual's antidepressant response. In a naturalistic prospective cohort study with a total of 190 fully assessed patients, improvement of depression symptoms during the 3 weeks following initiation of antidepressant therapy was recorded using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The SLC6A3 3' UTR 40-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and the SLC6A4 5' 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. There was a significantly smaller number of rapid responders among homozygous carriers of the DAT1 9-repeat allele (9/9) than among heterozygous (9/10) and homozygous (10/10) carriers of the 10-repeat allele (19 versus 37 versus 52%, respectively, P=0.0037). Median decline in HDRS score was 35, 40, and 52% in patients with the 9/9, 9/10, and 10/10 genotypes, respectively (P=0.013). The effect was found in all classes of medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics, mirtazapine, venlafaxine) and statistically significant also within the subgroup of patients having received SSRIs. The serotonin promoter insertion/deletion genotype had no effect in the entire study group, but there was an insignificant trend of better response in the l/l and l/s carriers who received SSRIs or mirtazapine. In conclusion, the dopamine transporter VNTR polymorphism influenced rapid response to antidepressant therapy. Compared with homozygous carriers of the 10-repeat allele, carriers of the 9/10 genotype had an odds ratio (OR) calculated by logistic regression analysis of 1.6 (95% CI 0.8-3.2) and carriers of the 9/9 genotype had an OR of 6.0 (1.5-24.4) for no or poor response.

OBJECTIVE: To study the association of genetic variants in 10 genes that regulate the CRF and arginine vasopressin systems with treatment response to citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) sample (N = 1768). DESIGN: Pharmacogenetic association study derived from the STAR*D study, a multicenter, prospective, open, 12-week effectiveness trial. SETTING: Outpatient primary care and psychiatric clinics. Patients Individuals with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder for whom DNA was available who were subsequently treated with citalopram hydrobromide for 4 to 12 weeks. Intervention Flexible doses of citalopram. Main Outcome Measure Association of genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the CRF system with response and remission to citalopram treatment at exit visit. RESULTS: One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs10473984) within the CRHBP locus showed a significant association with both remission (P = 6.0 x 10(-6); corrected, P = .0026) and reduction in depressive symptoms (P = 7.0 x 10(-7); corrected, P = .00031) in response to citalopram. The T allele of this SNP was associated with poorer treatment outcome in 2 of the 3 ethnic subsamples (African American and Hispanic), despite large differences in minor allele frequency. This association was more pronounced in patients with features of anxious depression (P = .008). The nonresponse allele was shown to be associated with overall higher plasma corticotropin levels and more pronounced dexamethasone suppression of corticotropin.

Stress-hemoconcentration, a result of psychological stress that might be a risk factor for the pathogenesis of CVD, has been studied in stress-challenge paradigms but has not been systematically studied in MDD. METHODS: Secondary analysis of stress hemoconcentration was performed on data from controls and subjects with mild to moderate MDD participating in an ongoing pharmacogenetic study of antidepressant treatment response to desipramine or fluoxetine. Hematologic and hemorheologic measures of stress-hemoconcentration included blood cell counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin, total serum protein, and albumin, and whole blood viscosity. FINDINGS: Subjects with mild to moderate MDD had significantly increased hemorheologic measures of stress-hemoconcentration and blood viscosity when compared to controls; these measures were correlated with depression severity. Measures of stress-hemoconcentration improved significantly after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Improvements in white blood cell count, red blood cell measures and plasma volume were correlated with decreased severity of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our secondary data analyses support that stress-hemoconcentration, possibly caused by decrements in plasma volume during psychological stress, is present in Mexican-American subjects with mild to moderate MDD at non-challenged baseline conditions. We also found that after antidepressant treatment hemorheologic measures of stress-hemoconcentration are improved and are correlated with improvement of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that antidepressant treatment may have a positive impact in CVD by ameliorating increased blood viscosity.

Even though a significant amount of the variance in the MDD phenotype is explained by inheritance, specific genetic variants conferring susceptibility to MDD explain only a minimal proportion of MDD causality. Moreover, genome-wide association studies have only identified two small-sized effect loci that reach genome-wide significance. In this study, a group of Mexican-American patients with MDD and controls recruited for a pharmacogenetic study were genotyped for nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and used to explore the interactions of multiple functional genetic variants with risk-classification tree analysis. The risk-classification tree analysis model and linkage disequilibrium blocks were used to replicate exploratory findings in the database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP) for major depression, and pathway analysis was performed to explore potential biological mechanisms using the branching events. In exploratory analyses, we found that risk-classification tree analysis, using 15 nsSNPs that had a nominal association with MDD diagnosis, identified multiple increased-MDD genotype clusters and significant additive interactions in combinations of genotype variants that were significantly associated with MDD. The results in the dbGaP for major depression disclosed a multidimensional dependent phenotype constituted of MDD plus significant modifiers (smoking, marriage status, age, alcohol abuse/dependence and gender), which then was used for the association tree analysis. The reconstructed tree analysis for the dbGaP data showed robust reliability and replicated most of the genes involved in the branching process found in our exploratory analyses. Pathway analysis using all six major events of branching (PSMD9, HSD3B1, BDNF, GHRHR, PDE6C and PDLIM5) was significant for positive regulation of cellular and biological processes that are relevant to growth and organ development. Our findings not only provide important insights into the biological pathways underlying innate susceptibility to MDD but also offer a predictive framework based on interactions of multiple functional genetic variants and environmental factors. These findings identify novel targets for therapeutics and for translation into preventive, clinical and personalized health care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/mp.2012.13,"Case-Control Studies;Depressive Disorder, Major/*genetics;*Gene-Environment Interaction;Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Genotype;Humans;Linkage Disequilibrium/genetics;Mexican Americans/genetics/psychology;*Models, Statistical;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Risk Factors",22449891,PMC3359641

This study investigated an in silico approach for ranking antidepressants based on their hypothetical likelihood of efficacy. We predicted the transcriptomic profile of citalopram remitters by performing an in silico transcriptomic-wide association study on STAR*D GWAS data (N = 1163). The transcriptional profile of remitters was compared with 21 antidepressant-induced gene expression profiles in five human cell lines available in the connectivity-map database. Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to determine the similarity between antidepressant-induced profiles and remitter profiles, subsequently calculating the average rank of antidepressants across the three methods and a p value for each rank by using a permutation procedure. The drugs with the top ranks were those having a high positive correlation with the expression profiles of remitters and that may have higher chances of efficacy in the tested patients. In MCF7 (breast cancer cell line), escitalopram had the highest average rank, with an average rank higher than expected by chance (p = 0.0014). In A375 (human melanoma) and PC3 (prostate cancer) cell lines, escitalopram and citalopram emerged as the second-highest ranked antidepressants, respectively (p = 0.0310 and 0.0276, respectively). In HA1E (kidney) and HT29 (colon cancer) cell types, citalopram and escitalopram did not fall among top antidepressants. The correlation between citalopram remitters' and (es)citalopram-induced expression profiles in three cell lines suggests that our approach may be useful and with future improvements, it can be applicable at the individual level to tailor treatment prescription.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41397-020-00186-5,"Antidepressive Agents/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Citalopram/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics;Computer Simulation;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/genetics;Drug Prescriptions;Gene Expression/drug effects;HT29 Cells;Humans;MCF-7 Cells;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use;Transcriptome/*drug effects/genetics;Gene Expression;Nonprescription Drugs;Prescriptions;Antidepressive Agents;Prescription Drugs",32943772,

However, there is no evidence that machine learning approaches combining multi-omics measures (e.g., genomics and plasma metabolomics) can achieve clinically meaningful predictions of outcomes to combination pharmacotherapy.

To assess whether metabolomics with functionally validated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) improves predictability over metabolomics alone, models were trained/tested with and without SNPs. Models trained with PGRN-AMPS' and CO-MED's escitalopram/citalopram patients predicted response in CO-MED's combination pharmacotherapy patients with accuracies of 76.6% (p < 0.01; AUC: 0.85) without and 77.5% (p < 0.01; AUC: 0.86) with SNPs. Then, models trained solely with PGRN-AMPS' escitalopram/citalopram patients predicted response in CO-MED's combination pharmacotherapy patients with accuracies of 75.3% (p < 0.05; AUC: 0.84) without and 77.5% (p < 0.01; AUC: 0.86) with SNPs, demonstrating cross-trial replication of predictions. Plasma hydroxylated sphingomyelins were prominent predictors of treatment outcomes. To explore the relationship between SNPs and hydroxylated sphingomyelins, we conducted multi-omics integration network analysis. Sphingomyelins clustered with SNPs and metabolites related to monoamine neurotransmission, suggesting a potential functional relationship. These results suggest that integrating specific metabolites and SNPs achieves accurate predictions of treatment response across classes of antidepressants. Finally, these results motivate functional investigation into how sphingomyelins might influence MDD pathophysiology, antidepressant response, or both.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Included""}",10.1038/s41398-021-01632-z,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Citalopram/therapeutic use;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Humans;Machine Learning;Treatment Outcome;Cross-Over Studies;Acute-Phase Reaction;Antidepressive Agents",34620827,PMC8497535

Genetic variation in FKBP5 plays a role in antidepressant response. The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess the role of genetic variation in FKBP5, identified by both Sanger and Next Generation DNA resequencing, as well as genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with FKBP5 expression in the response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment of major depressive disorder. METHODS: We identified 657 SNPs in FKBP5 by Next Generation sequencing of 96 DNA samples from white patients, and 149 SNPs were selected for the genotyping together with 235 SNPs that were trans-associated with variation in FKBP5 expression in lymphoblastoid cells. A total of 529 DNA samples from the Mayo Clinic PGRN-SSRI Pharmacogenomic trial for which genome-wide SNPs had already been obtained were genotyped for these 384 SNPs, and associations with treatment outcomes were determined. The most significant SNPs were genotyped using 96 DNA samples from white non-Hispanic patients of the NIMH-supported Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study to attempt replication, followed by functional genomic studies. RESULTS: Genotype-phenotype association analysis indicated that rs352428 was associated with both 8-week treatment response in the Mayo study (odds ratio=0.49; P=0.003) and 6-week response in the STAR*D replication study (odds ratio=0.74; P=0.05). The electrophoresis mobility shift assay and the reporter gene assay confirmed the possible role of this SNP in transcription regulation.

In order to resolve these inconsistencies, we conducted a study in a large cohort of patients with major depressive disorder with the aim to unravel the association of ABCB1 variants with adverse effects of antidepressants and in particular with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which display affinity as substrate for P-gp. The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) study was used as a clinical sample. For 424 patients data were available on drug use, side effects.

Moreover, serotonergic effects (sleeplessness, gastrointestinal complaints and sexual effects) were significantly predicted by these variants and haplotype (P=0.002/0.003).

Individual differences in relevant genes may account for some of the reported variability in the relationship between DMN connectivity and PTSD. In this study, we investigated this possibility using genome-wide association study (GWAS) derived polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for relevant psychiatric traits. We hypothesized that the association between PTSD and DMN connectivity would be moderated by genetic risk for one or more psychiatric traits such that individuals with elevated polygenic risk for psychopathology and severe PTSD would exhibit disrupted DMN connectivity. METHODS: Participants were 156 white, non-Hispanic veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who were genotyped and underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessment. PRSs for neuroticism, anxiety, major depressive disorder, and cross-disorder risk (based on five psychiatric disorders) were calculated using summary statistics from published large-scale consortia-based GWASs. RESULTS: Cross-disorder polygenic risk influenced the relationship between DMN connectivity and PTSD symptom severity such that individuals at greater genetic risk showed a significant negative association between PTSD symptom severity and connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. Polygenic risk for neuroticism, anxiety, and major depressive disorder did not influence DMN connectivity directly or through an interaction with PTSD.

This study examined mild traumatic brain injury and genetic risk as predictors of reduced cortical thickness in brain regions previously associated with early Alzheimer's disease, and their relationship with episodic memory. Participants were 160 Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans between the ages of 19 and 58, many of whom carried mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses. Whole-genome polygenic risk scores for the development of Alzheimer's disease were calculated using summary statistics from the largest Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association study to date. Results showed that mild traumatic brain injury moderated the relationship between genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and cortical thickness, such that individuals with mild traumatic brain injury and high genetic risk showed reduced cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable regions. Among males with mild traumatic brain injury, high genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease was associated with cortical thinning as a function of time since injury. A moderated mediation analysis showed that mild traumatic brain injury and high genetic risk indirectly influenced episodic memory performance through cortical thickness, suggesting that cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable brain regions is a mechanism for reduced memory performance. Finally, analyses that examined the apolipoprotein E4 allele, post-traumatic stress disorder, and genetic risk for schizophrenia and depression confirmed the specificity of the Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk finding. These results provide evidence that mild traumatic brain injury is associated with greater neurodegeneration and reduced memory performance in individuals at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, with the caveat that the order of causal effects cannot be inferred from cross-sectional studies. These results underscore the importance of documenting head injuries even within the mild range as they may interact with genetic risk to produce negative long-term health consequences such as neurodegenerative disease.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1093/brain/aww344,"Adult;Alzheimer Disease/complications/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*pathology;Apolipoproteins E/genetics;Brain Injuries, Traumatic/complications/diagnostic imaging/*pathology;Cerebral Cortex/diagnostic imaging/*pathology;Cross-Sectional Studies;Disease Progression;Female;Genome-Wide Association Study;Genotype;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales;Regression Analysis;Risk Factors;Veterans;Young Adult;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Brain Injuries",28077398,PMC6075586

In this study we used electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics to gain insights into the mechanisms of action of escitalopram/citalopram focusing on a set of 31 metabolites from neurotransmitter-related pathways. Overall, 290 unipolar patients with major depressive disorder were profiled at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of drug treatment. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD(17)) scores gauged depressive symptom severity. More significant metabolic changes were found after 8 weeks than 4 weeks post baseline. Within the tryptophan pathway, we noted significant reductions in serotonin (5HT) and increases in indoles that are known to be influenced by human gut microbial cometabolism. 5HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5HIAA), and the ratio of 5HIAA/5HT showed significant correlations to temporal changes in HRSD(17) scores. In the tyrosine pathway, changes were observed in the end products of the catecholamines, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and vinylmandelic acid. Furthermore, two phenolic acids, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, produced through noncanconical pathways, were increased with drug exposure. In the purine pathway, significant reductions in hypoxanthine and xanthine levels were observed. Examination of metabolite interactions through differential partial correlation networks revealed changes in guanosine-homogentisic acid and methionine-tyrosine interactions associated with HRSD(17). Genetic association studies using the ratios of these interacting pairs of metabolites highlighted two genetic loci harboring genes previously linked to depression, neurotransmission, or neurodegeneration. Overall, exposure to escitalopram/citalopram results in shifts in metabolism through noncanonical pathways, which suggest possible roles for the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and inflammation-related mechanisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/s41398-019-0507-5,"Adult;Citalopram/*pharmacology;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects;Humans;Male;Metabolome/*drug effects;Metabolomics;Middle Aged;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology;Severity of Illness Index;Signal Transduction/*drug effects;Citalopram",31273200,PMC6609722

This analysis explores moderators of stress coping to determine which subgroups of FCs benefited most from SMART-3RP. METHODS: 102 FCs from Mass General Brigham hospitals engaged in the adapted SMART-3RP. Assessments were completed at group entry (Week 0) and completion (Week 4). The primary outcome was stress coping, and we examined 15 possible baseline moderators. We fit linear mixed effects regression models and assessed potential baseline moderators using a likelihood ratio test. We report model-based estimates and confidence intervals for each moderator-by-time interaction (i.e., differential effect), where positive/negative values indicate more/less improvement in average perceived stress coping. RESULTS: Stress coping improved from Week 0 to Week 4 (mean improvement [95% CI] = 0.9 [0.6 to 1.2]). FCs with higher anxiety (differential effect [95% CI] = 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4]), depression (0.4 [0.2 to 0.6]), and loneliness (0.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), but lower levels of mindfulness (CAMS-R(focus): 1.0 [0.4 to 1.6]; CAMS-R(accept): 1.3 [0.7 to 2.0]) and self-compassion (0.4, [0.1 to 0.8]) at baseline experienced greater benefits in perceived stress coping from the SMART-3RP. Baseline health uncertainty along with sociodemographic and work characteristics did not moderate stress coping. DISCUSSION: Results highlight particular sub-populations of FCs that may benefit more from a stress management intervention, especially during emergency responses (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.036,"Adaptation, Psychological;*COVID-19;Humans;Pandemics;*Resilience, Psychological;SARS-CoV-2;Stress, Psychological/epidemiology/therapy",34243059,PMC8712555
Differential responses to lithium in hyperexcitable neurons from patients with bipolar disorder.,2015,11,5,Nature,1476-4687 (Electronic),527,7576,95-9,Mertens J and Wang QW and Kim Y and Yu DX and Pham S and Yang B and Zheng Y and Diffenderfer KE and Zhang J and Soltani S and Eames T and Schafer ST and Boyer L and Marchetto MC and Nurnberger JI and Calabrese JR and Ødegaard KJ and McCarthy MJ and Zandi PP and Alda M and Nievergelt CM and Mi S and Brennand KJ and Kelsoe JR and Gage FH and Yao J,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26524527/,eng,,,"Bipolar disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania and depression; without treatment, 15% of patients commit suicide. Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity. Previous neuropathological studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder or animal models, such as reduced glial cell number in the prefrontal cortex of patients, upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and C pathways and changes in neurotransmission. However, the roles and causation of these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca(2+) imaging, we have observed hyperactive action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore, hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs aimed at its clinical treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: preclinical model",10.1038/nature15526,Action Potentials/*drug effects;Antipsychotic Agents/*pharmacology;Bipolar Disorder/*pathology;Calcium Signaling/drug effects;Dentate Gyrus/drug effects/pathology;Endophenotypes;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/pathology;Lithium Compounds/*pharmacology;Male;Mitochondria/pathology;Neurons/*drug effects/*pathology;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Bipolar Disorder;Lithium,26524527,PMC4742055

Major depressive disorder treatment is still symptomatic and is the leading cause of (~30%) failure of the current antidepressant therapy. Here we comprehended the probable genes and pathways commonly associated with antidepressant response and MDD. A systematic review was conducted, and candidate genes/pathways associated with antidepressant response and MDD were identified using an integrative genetics approach. Initially, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/genes found to be significantly associated with antidepressant response were systematically reviewed and retrieved from the candidate studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, significant variations concerning MDD susceptibility were extracted from GWAS only. We found 245 (Set A) and 800 (Set B) significantly associated genes with antidepressant response and MDD, respectively. Further, gene set enrichment analysis revealed the top five co-occurring molecular pathways (p ≤ 0.05) among the two sets of genes: Cushing syndrome, Axon guidance, cAMP signaling pathway, Insulin secretion, and Glutamatergic synapse, wherein all show a very close relation to synaptic plasticity. Integrative analyses of candidate gene and genome-wide association studies would enable us to investigate the putative targets for the development of disease etiology-based antidepressant that might be more promising than current ones.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.3390/ijms20081993,"Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism;Genome-Wide Association Study;Genomics/methods;Humans;*Pharmacogenomic Variants;*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use;Signal Transduction/drug effects;Workflow;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors",31018568,PMC6514561

Buprenorphine/samidorphan (BUP/SAM) combination is an investigational opioid system modulator for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). To confirm results from early studies, we report the efficacy and safety of BUP/SAM as adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD and an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy (ADT) in FORWARD-4 and FORWARD-5: two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that utilized the same sequential parallel-comparison design. Efficacy was measured using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). FORWARD-5 achieved the primary endpoint and demonstrated that adjunctive BUP/SAM 2 mg/2 mg was superior to placebo (average difference change from baseline to week 3 through end of treatment [EOT] in MADRS-6 and -10 versus placebo: -1.5, P = 0.018; -1.9, P = 0.026, respectively). FORWARD-4 did not achieve the primary endpoint (change from baseline in MADRS-10 at week 5 versus placebo: -1.8, P = 0.109), although separate analyses showed significant treatment differences at other timepoints using traditional, regulatory-accepted endpoints such as reduction in MADRS-10 at EOT. The pooled analysis of the two studies demonstrated consistently greater reduction in MADRS-10 scores from baseline for BUP/SAM 2 mg/2 mg versus placebo at multiple timepoints including EOT and average change from baseline to week 3 through EOT (-1.8, P = 0.010; -1.8, P = 0.004, respectively). The overall effect size (Hedges' g) in the pooled analyses for MADRS-10 change from baseline to EOT was 0.22. Overall, BUP/SAM was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events (AEs) being mild or moderate in severity. The most common AEs, occurring in ≥5% of patients in the BUP/SAM 2 mg/2 mg treatment group, which was more frequently than the placebo group, included nausea, constipation, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, fatigue, and sedation. There was minimal evidence of abuse, and no evidence of dependence or opioid withdrawal by AEs or objective measures. This report describes adjunctive BUP/SAM 2 mg/2 mg combination, a therapy with a novel opioidergic mechanism of action, as a potential new treatment option for patients with MDD who have an inadequate response to currently available ADT.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1038/s41380-018-0284-1,"Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;Buprenorphine/*therapeutic use;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy/psychology;Double-Blind Method;Drug Therapy, Combination;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Naltrexone/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use;Treatment Outcome;Buprenorphine;Depressive Disorder;Depressive Disorder, Major;Analgesics, Opioid",30374191,PMC7303008

The objective of this analysis was to address whether a dose increase provided further improvement in cases of insufficient response using data from an existing randomized clinical trial. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with MDD who failed to respond to SAMe 1,600 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day, or placebo for 6 weeks were treated with doubled doses of the allocated treatments for the following 6 weeks. Changes in 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated, and Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events-Specific Inquiry were compared between the lower and higher dose treatments in each treatment group and among the higher dose treatments of SAMe, escitalopram, and placebo. RESULTS: Various depression severity scores decreased significantly for all three treatment arms during the higher dose treatment. No within-group and between-group differences were found in any of the efficacy measures when comparing the doses and treatments. There was a significant difference in reported abdominal discomfort among patients receiving the higher dose of SAMe (31.3%), compared to escitalopram (8.7%) and placebo (3.8%) (χ2=7.32, p = 0.026). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small. The study duration for dose increase was relatively short. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDD failing to respond to 1,600 mg/day of SAMe may improve after increasing the dose to 3,200 mg/day, but we cannot rule out the contribution of a placebo effect and time-related improvement. The risk of abdominal discomfort may be increased with higher doses of SAMe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not pertinent",10.1016/j.jad.2019.10.040,"Adult;Antidepressive Agents/*administration & dosage;Citalopram/*administration & dosage;Depressive Disorder, Major/*drug therapy;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Double-Blind Method;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;S-Adenosylmethionine/*administration & dosage;Treatment Outcome;Depressive Disorder;Citalopram;Depressive Disorder, Major;Methionine",31733455,PMC6917851

Our previous genome-wide association study identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signal across the glutamate-rich 3 (ERICH3) gene that was nearly genome-wide significantly associated with plasma serotonin (5-HT) concentrations, which were themselves associated with SSRI response for MDD patients enrolled in the Mayo Clinic PGRN-AMPS SSRI trial. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis which demonstrated that those SNPs were significantly associated with SSRI treatment outcomes in four independent MDD trials. However, the function of ERICH3 and molecular mechanism(s) by which it might be associated with plasma 5-HT concentrations and SSRI clinical response remained unclear. Therefore, we characterized the human ERICH3 gene functionally and identified ERICH3 mRNA transcripts and protein isoforms that are highly expressed in central nervous system cells. Coimmunoprecipitation identified a series of ERICH3 interacting proteins including clathrin heavy chain which are known to play a role in vesicular function. Immunofluorescence showed ERICH3 colocalization with 5-HT in vesicle-like structures, and ERICH3 knock-out dramatically decreased 5-HT staining in SK-N-SH cells as well as 5-HT concentrations in the culture media and cell lysates without changing the expression of 5-HT synthesizing or metabolizing enzymes. Finally, immunofluorescence also showed ERICH3 colocalization with dopamine in human iPSC-derived neurons. These results suggest that ERICH3 may play a significant role in vesicular function in serotonergic and other neuronal cell types, which might help explain its association with antidepressant treatment response.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review",10.1038/s41380-020-00940-y,"Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use;*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy/genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Serotonin/therapeutic use;Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use;Antidepressive Agents",33230203,PMC8141066

Patients with TRD were randomized in a double-blind fashion to a single infusion of IV ketamine or IV midazolam placebo. Suicidal ideation was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) suicide item at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days post infusion. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was defined as a MADRS suicide item score ≥2. Forty patients who received IV ketamine and 16 who received IV midazolam had suicide item scores of ≥2 at baseline (IV ketamine group mean 2.90±0.74; IV midazolam group 2.69±0.70). The mean suicide scores of these groups differed significantly from each other on day 30; the IV ketamine group had a lower mean score than controls (2.03±1.59 vs. 3.00±1.41, t-test p = 0.049; Hedges' g 0.71). Among patients with a suicide score of ≥2 at baseline and <2 at day 3, the two groups did not differ significantly on mean scores changes at days 3, 5, 7, 14 or 30. Recurrence of suicidal ideation was extensive in both treatment groups. A single infusion of IV ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in TRD out to 30 days post infusion, but early anti-suicidal effects appear to diminish rapidly. This post-hoc analysis was not powered to compare different doses of ketamine. A single infusion of IV ketamine might have a role as an adjunct to standard treatments in patients with TRD and suicidal ideation.

The aim of the study was to conduct a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify novel genetic variants associated with cannabis use disorder. METHODS: To conduct this GWAS meta-analysis of cannabis use disorder and identify associations with genetic loci, we used samples from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Substance Use Disorders working group, iPSYCH, and deCODE (20 916 case samples, 363 116 control samples in total), contrasting cannabis use disorder cases with controls. To examine the genetic overlap between cannabis use disorder and 22 traits of interest (chosen because of previously published phenotypic correlations [eg, psychiatric disorders] or hypothesised associations [eg, chronotype] with cannabis use disorder), we used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate genetic correlations. FINDINGS: We identified two genome-wide significant loci: a novel chromosome 7 locus (FOXP2, lead single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs7783012; odds ratio [OR] 1·11, 95% CI 1·07-1·15, p=1·84 × 10(-9)) and the previously identified chromosome 8 locus (near CHRNA2 and EPHX2, lead SNP rs4732724; OR 0·89, 95% CI 0·86-0·93, p=6·46 × 10(-9)). Cannabis use disorder and cannabis use were genetically correlated (r(g) 0·50, p=1·50 × 10(-21)), but they showed significantly different genetic correlations with 12 of the 22 traits we tested, suggesting at least partially different genetic underpinnings of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use disorder was positively genetically correlated with other psychopathology, including ADHD, major depression, and schizophrenia. INTERPRETATION: These findings support the theory that cannabis use disorder has shared genetic liability with other psychopathology, and there is a distinction between genetic liability to cannabis use and cannabis use disorder.

Evidence suggests that a quantitative approach to PTSD phenotype measurement and incorporation of lifetime trauma exposure (LTE) information could enhance the discovery power of PTSD genome-wide association studies (GWASs). METHODS: A GWAS on PTSD symptoms was performed in 51 cohorts followed by a fixed-effects meta-analysis (N = 182,199 European ancestry participants). A GWAS of LTE burden was performed in the UK Biobank cohort (N = 132,988). Genetic correlations were evaluated with linkage disequilibrium score regression. Multivariate analysis was performed using Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS. Functional mapping and annotation of leading loci was performed with FUMA. Replication was evaluated using the Million Veteran Program GWAS of PTSD total symptoms. RESULTS: GWASs of PTSD symptoms and LTE burden identified 5 and 6 independent genome-wide significant loci, respectively. There was a 72% genetic correlation between PTSD and LTE. PTSD and LTE showed largely similar patterns of genetic correlation with other traits, albeit with some distinctions. Adjusting PTSD for LTE reduced PTSD heritability by 31%. Multivariate analysis of PTSD and LTE increased the effective sample size of the PTSD GWAS by 20% and identified 4 additional loci. Four of these 9 PTSD loci were independently replicated in the Million Veteran Program. CONCLUSIONS: Through using a quantitative trait measure of PTSD, we identified novel risk loci not previously identified using prior case-control analyses. PTSD and LTE have a high genetic overlap that can be leveraged to increase discovery power through multivariate methods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome (diagnosis not treatment outcome)",10.1016/j.biopsych.2021.09.020,"Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Humans;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics;*Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/genetics;Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",34865855,PMC8917986

Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [r(g) ], twin-based = 0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge eating, AN without binge eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Total study sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (r(g) = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (r(g) = 0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge eating (r(g) = 0.27; q = 0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed between three nondiagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge eating (r(gs) = -0.19 to -0.23; qs < 0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer significant after co-varying for major depressive disorder loci. The patterns of association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships among these behaviors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""pasqualeparibello""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: wrong outcome",10.1111/adb.12880,"Alcoholism/genetics;Depressive Disorder, Major/genetics;Feeding and Eating Disorders/*genetics;Genome-Wide Association Study;Humans;Linkage Disequilibrium;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Risk Factors;Schizophrenia/genetics;Substance-Related Disorders/*genetics;Tobacco Use Disorder/genetics;Substance-Related Disorders;Eating Disorders;Genome;Genomics",32064741,PMC7429266
